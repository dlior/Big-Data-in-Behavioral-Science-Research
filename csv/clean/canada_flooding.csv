And does it claim ground zero alone or is it a ""this one of many"" implication.  Because my mind went to ""what about Rwanda, Syria, Yemen, Beirut, Pakistan...?"". Maybe the place  in the poem is trying to stand for more places than the New Vancouver Island, but the cormorants seemed very place specific.  Anyway, I ramble.Mechanical birds?  What are you referring to there?Reading again, there are other places I might enjoy trimming.  I have imagined cutting out the explanation of what the hard truth is ( ""that there is only peril..."" ).  I also imagined ending with ""No whimpers here."". But I don't know, just musings.Lastly, not sure how well the play on ""lost in illusions"" / ""allusions to despair and sadness.""

6,no,collapse,Bow_River,"British Columbia, Canada is getting a Crash Course in Collapse.","People in BC live in floodplains and right next to forests.  Floodplains flood naturally and forests burn naturally.  It is the hubris of man to think otherwise.  BC pumped out a lake next to a major river and build a community on it.  Obvious that is going to flood.  That has nothing to do with capitalism or climate change.  It is just 100% stupid.  You can't win an argument against mother nature.The real collapse is the coming energy shortage as oil production falls off a cliff from ESG mandates and renewable additions are for much less energy.  As well the global food industry is going to be severely damaged from higher oil prices as food production is really a subset of the oil industry.  I have a hobby farm and do organic farming, let me tell you the cost of the renewable energy I have and the organic farming is staggering.  I'm wealthy and do it for fun and as a prepper to get ready for the low energy future, but my energy and food cost is much higher that what people would think (including time for farming).The key to avoiding collapse is to find a sustainable community (like if you build a house would it be there in 200 years without human intervention) where you can use off grid energy sources (purchased in next two years as skyrocketing demand will make it unattainable), produce much of your own food and that has robust connections to legacy oil and gas to support industry and higher intensity farming for as long as possible.  Places lacking this will be cutoff from modern industrialized living.  People in major coastal cities are going to be fretting about climate change, buying expensive Teslas while their way of life will become rapidly unaffordable and unstainable thanks to 7% natural decline in O&G production coupled with low investment in new production.  Having an electric car won't help them as industrial society runs on oil, gas and coal and will for decades.  Already in the US we can see cities being taken over by migrants and homeless.  If your energy comes at the end of a major transmission pipeline, you'll be first to get cutoff as supplies dwindle and climate alarmists attack vulnerable rural transmission equipment.NE BC is a particular good location for future sustainability.  Vancouver island has good hydro sources and a good growing climate in some regions.  No oil for tractors and no gas for heat though.

The City of Abbotsford issued [an evacuation order for this area last night](https://twitter.com/City_Abbotsford/status/1460813262342148103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1460813262342148103%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvancouversun.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fbreaking-news-catastrophic-flood-warning-issued-as-pump-failure-leads-to-fraser-river-flooding).The article is quite detailed and explanatory, so I've quoted it in full below, with my emphasis in bold:>**David Carrigg - Catastrophic flood warning issued for Sumas Prairie as pump system set to fail**  >  >*Tens of thousands of dairy cows at risk of drowning and hundreds of thousands of chickens*  >  >\-  >  >**The Fraser River was predicted to flood into the Sumas Prairie and surrounding areas on Tuesday night, potentially leading to catastrophic damage, significant risk to human life and devastation of livestock.**  >  >**‚ÄúThis event is anticipated to be catastrophic. Residents who cannot evacuate safely are asked to call 911 and report your location immediately,‚Äù said B.C.‚Äôs Public Safety Minister, in a statement issued shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday.**  >  >**‚ÄúIf you are in the Sumas Prairie and have not already evacuated, you must do so immediately. Do not stay for livestock or property. Flood conditions have escalated quickly and pose a significant risk to life.‚Äù**  >  >**City of Abbotsford mayor Henry Braun made an urgent call at 8 p.m. for all people to immediately evacuate the area. That included hundreds of farmers who had stayed back to take care of their livestock and birds after an evacuation order earlier because of initial flooding caused by an overflowing river just south of the border.**  >  >The city has a news conference planned for 7:30 a.m.  >  >‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs hard for farmers to leave their life‚Äôs work. But lives are more important to me right now than livestock and chickens,‚Äù Braun said.  >  >**Fraser Valley farmers supply 50 per cent of all B.C.‚Äôs eggs, chickens and dairy products. There are 45,000 dairy cows in the valley, and each chicken farm has around 25,000 birds.**  >  >**The reason for the urgent announcement was the imminent failure of the key Barrowtown Pump Station ‚Äî a four-pump station that keeps the Fraser River out of the Sumas Lake Canal and protects many square kilometres of prime agricultural land.**  >  >**Abbotsford Fire Rescue Service Chief Darren Lee said that sandbags were being placed around the pump station to buy time and that smaller pumps were being flown in to beef up the station. All four pumps were working, but they were unable to stop the rise of the water in the canal and once water got into the pumping station, he said, the pumps would fail.**  >  >If the pumps do fail, an emergency broadcast will be made to residents of Abbotsford and Chilliwack by text message.  >  >In Farnworth‚Äôs late evening statement, he said he has been contact with Braun and that Emergency Management BC is ready to issue a broadcast intrusive alert through the Alert Ready system.  >  >However, he said the city has indicated that it does not want to issue an alert at this time.  >  >Lee said that swift water rescue assets were being sent to the area so that at first light they could be used if people were stranded by rising water. Once the pump station fails, the water level was expected to reach around 10 feet (three metres) in the prairie ‚Äî which could take from two to seven days.  >  >**‚ÄúWith the failure of this key piece of infrastructure, water within the Sumas Prairie will not be able to be pumped out and water from the Fraser River will begin entering the already flooded Sumas Prairie area,‚Äù the City of Abbotsford wrote in a prepared statement telling people to leave the area.**  >  >**The event is anticipated to be catastrophic. The City of Abbotsford has shut off domestic water service to the area.**  >  >In the city‚Äôs warning to remaining residents to get out fast, it states there is a ‚Äúsignificant risk to life.‚Äù  >  >Braun said that he spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and B.C. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth on Tuesday night and they had promised to provide pumps and other equipment and help in any way they could.  >  >In a statement issued late Tuesday night Farnworth echoed Braun‚Äôs plea to residents to get to safety right away.  >  >‚ÄúIf you are in the Sumas Prairie and have not already evacuated, you must do so immediately. Do not stay for livestock or property. Flood conditions have escalated quickly and pose a significant risk to life,‚Äù he said in the statement. ‚ÄúThis event is anticipated to be catastrophic. Residents who cannot evacuate safely are asked to call 911 and report your location immediately.‚Äù  >  >Farnworth also said that the province is providing the City of Abbotsford with any resources it needs.  >  >‚ÄúI have also been in contact with Bill Blair, federal Minister of Emergency Preparedness, to request federal assistance on this incident and the flooding situation in general. This includes Canadian Armed Forces ground and air support,‚Äù Farnworth added.  >  >**According to** **a 2013 report written by City of Abbotsford staff** \[*edit: anyone have the Council report link?*\] **seeking money to upgrade the electrical system in the Barrowtown facility (built between 1977 and 1983), if the station fails it will result in around $500 million in damages and impact ‚Äúmajor transportation and utility corridors such as Highway 11, 1, railways and underground gas/oil lines.**‚Äù  >  >**‚ÄúMajor flooding in the area would significantly impact food producers and food processing companies, and cause job losses which typically takes 5-10 years to recover,‚Äù the report stated. There are about 1,400 farms in the Sumas Prairie.**  >  >**The last time a major flood event occurred in the Fraser River was in May 1948 when 16,000 people were forced from their homes and 220 square kilometres of land ended up under water.

15,no,collapse,SebWilms2002,Large funnel cloud near Vancouver (Canada) prompts tornado watch,"I have a nearly unbroken view of the horizon from where I live, and love watching the clouds. I was alerted that something was up when I heard thunder yesterday. I opened the blinds and watched several lightening strikes as a very unfamiliar looking cloud system moved past. I know that tornados are exceedingly rare here, but I could see what I thought was a very weak funnel cloud forming. I held a finger against the window as a reference point against the distant clouds to see if I could observe any rotation, and to my surprise I could. I joked with a few people that we might see Vancouver's first major tornado, and everyone brushed it off. Within 10 minutes the system had blown past us out of my line of sight, and then the warnings began rolling in and my instinct was proven correct. I wouldn't say I have climate anxiety, but I have always enjoyed watching the skies. But now seeing the back to back ""unprecedented"" weather events around me, I feel like I almost have a duty to watch the skies. u/hitortabi is 100% correct. Our 911 operators and first responders are in literal collapse. There was just an article this week about the 911 operators that field the majority of calls in the province. They talked about how only years ago, seeing 911 calls hit a 10 second wait time was enough to induce anxiety in them, and now they're regularly seeing minutes long wait times. Pair that with our lack of warning systems, and we're basically a perfect storm for a mass casualty event if/when a major weather event lands anywhere in the Lower Mainland. With the way things are escalating weather wise, it feels like just a matter of time until our province is in the headlines with another ""once in 1000 years"" weather event, except with a higher body count.",,9,,,/r/collapse/comments/qof61l/large_funnel_cloud_near_vancouver_canada_prompts/hjoes2c/,07/11/2021 14:40,2021,11,7,canada_flooding

32,no,canada,aeo1us,BC Floods Megathread,"My family and I left Washington State on Sunday. I'm Canadian and haven't been to Canada in 20 months. We entered Canada at the Abbotsford crossing. It's pouring rain.We didn't realize how serious it was until we got to Hope and the Transcanada and Yellowhead were closed. The only way out was the crowsnest pass. As we drove we passed an accident in the opposite lane. The lineup went for tens of kilometers. We now realized we were in the only working highway lane. We got to Princeton as the sun was setting.My wife wanted to stay as we have a 5 month old baby and 13 month old dog. But I wanted to be in a city with resources. So I made the call to drive the 2 hours, in the storming dark, to drive to Kelowna. I was terrified I was making the wrong decision.As we went up Highway 5A we steered around two boulders that were in the middle of the road. As well as three stopped vehicles half in our lane, half on the non-existant shoulder. We eventually caught up with a long train of vehicles led by one slow vehicle (no blame there). The train of vehicles growing behind us.We arrived at the junction of 97C and *everyone* continued to go to Merritt for the night as it was only a few km away vs. a lot more for Kelowna. My wife (who is American and unfamiliar with the towns and roads) mentioned how scary it is to go in the opposite direction everyone else is going. All I said is, ""every time I've driven through Merritt the weather has been terrible. We can't go there. It won't be safe."" We arrived in Kelowna and honestly it didn't really hit us until a day after at how close we came to being stranded. Every town we visited was devastated up until Kelowna. It felt like we were in an apocalypse movie and we were the only family that made it out.We spent two nights in Kelowna to wait the storm out as we continue  onto Edmonton to meet family. I write this from Invermere. We'll wait here another night if we need to.Update: Made it to Edmonton safe!",,92,,,/r/canada/comments/qvrbdb/bc_floods_megathread/hl00lxq/,17/11/2021 15:55,2021,11,17,canada_flooding

Several hundred thousand acres are about to be submerged beneath raging floodwaters, with no way to drain them.This isn't the exciting thing, though. Nor is that every road and rail link out of the lower mainland is destroyed with no date of re-opening. They might have the longest and most treacherous route, the 99, open by next week.https://twitter.com/KamilKaramali/status/1460691884041400322Bobbing there in the Coquihalla River, where its protective road has been ripped off, is 200m of the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

32,no,canada,coffeeinvenice,BC Floods Megathread,"As global warming due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions continue, natural systems that were once relatively stable, measurable and predictable will become increasingly unstable. Developed societies like British Columbia will have to spend more and more time, money, resources, and attention to mitigating the consequences of that instability. But the problem is, climate change-induced natural disasters will not be a one-time thing. Yes, people will clean up after a flood or a typhoon. But the floods and the typhoons are going to happen again. Because the drivers of the natural disasters - human greenhouse gas emissions - have not gone away. Actually, they are just getting stronger.The result for developed civilizations like British Columbia is that more and more resources will be devoted to responding to instabilities and attempting to maintain stabilities that were once gotten for free. Eventually, every developed civilization will start to run out of resources to be able to do so. It's like having a poisonous snake biting a patient's hand, that is continuously injecting venom into the patient's body, and doctors are unable to remove it. They respond by continuously injecting antivenom into the patient. The problem is, even if the antivenom works for a while, eventually you are going to run out of it. And cycling between high venom-high antivenom levels in the bloodstream is eventually going to cause problems in other organs of the body. There will be a positive feedback loop, sometimes in ways that the doctors can't even predict now, that will eventually kill the patient.Some carbonate rock formations in Siberia are now emitting methane as a result of summer heat waves over the past two years. Something I've never heard of before and I don't think any scientist ever foresaw happening. It was/is an unknown unknown.

Both orders in effect until December 1st** ***Province prioritizes fuel for essential vehicles, introduces travel restrictions***Source:  [https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021EMBC0073-002212](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021EMBC0073-002212)To help keep people safe and re-establish the movement of critical goods and services following severe flooding and landslides, the Province is taking temporary measures to ensure fuel (gas and diesel) is prioritized for essential vehicles, while keeping it available to British Columbians.Measures to restrict non-essential travel to and from impacted areas are also being introduced.‚ÄúWe are asking people to limit their fuel consumption and vehicle travel at this time and are putting in place orders under the provincial state of emergency to support this,‚Äù said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. ‚ÄúThese steps will keep commercial traffic moving, stabilize our supply chains and make sure everyone gets home safely. We are asking people not to travel through severely affected areas ‚Äì for their own well-being, but also to make sure the fuel we do have goes toward the services people need in this time of crisis.‚ÄùFarnworth has issued two new orders using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The first brings in a temporary order to ensure fuel remains available for essential vehicles in affected areas of the province.This order, effective immediately, until Dec. 1, 2021, applies to all fuel suppliers in the Lower Mainland-to-Hope region, the Sea-to-Sky region, Sunshine Coast, the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island.Under this order, essential vehicles will have unrestricted access to fuel as required, using predominately commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations). A full list of these essential vehicles is available in the backgrounder.Non-essential vehicles, including the general public, will still have access to fuel available through retail gas stations. People will be limited to 30 litres per trip to the gas station.¬†The Province will be working with gas retailers and distributors to implement this order to make sure people are not exceeding their allotted limit per trip. As part of this order, gas retailers will be required to ensure remaining gasoline reserves last¬†until Dec. 1, 2021. Anyone who is abusive, threatening or belligerent to gas station workers can be subject to a fine under the order.‚ÄúWhen our¬†province is faced with an emergency, British Columbians step up,‚Äù Farnworth said. ‚ÄúWe have a steady supply of gas to support all our essential vehicles and we will get through these restrictions together by staying calm, only buying what we need and looking out for each other. These measures are necessary during temporary shortages as work is under way to re-establish B.C.‚Äôs fuel supply.‚ÄùUnder the order, retail gas stations and wholesale distributors will be prohibited from profit-margin price gouging and people will be prohibited from buying gas for the purpose of reselling it.These restrictions will ensure a steady fuel supply to British Columbians, while efforts are undertaken to fix damage to roadways, establish alternative access to fuel through new routes, and re-establishing the flow of fuel through the Transmountain Pipeline that has been offline as a result of the recent weather events.The order does not affect natural gas or heating oil used to heat homes.The second order prohibits non-essential travel along severely affected highways:* Highway 99: from the junction of Highway 99 and Lillooet River Road to the BC Hydro Seton Lake Campsite access in Lillooet.¬†Only passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles up to 14,500 kilograms will be permitted.* Highway 3: from the junction of Highway 5 and Highway 3 in Hope to the west entrance to Princeton from Highway 3.* Highway 7: from the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 9 in Agassiz to the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 1 in Hope.This order will be in effect starting today as these highways start to reopen. It applies to non-essential travel along specific sections of highways between the Lower Mainland and Interior of British Columbia. There are circumstances where travel is essential and permitted, specifically for the movement of any goods that are necessary for the health, safety and well-being of British Columbians. (A full list follows in a backgrounder.) As the backlog of essential traffic clears, restrictions on essential travel can be eased.These measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency, using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The act allows the minister to implement all procedures the minister considers necessary to prevent, respond to or alleviate the effects of an emergency, including controlling or prohibiting travel to or from any area of British Columbia.***Essential vehicles defined***The following vehicles will have access to commercial gas stations where available fuel will be prioritized.¬†For vehicles that do not typically access commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations), the Province is working to provide priority access.The groups are defined as:* Emergency service vehicles (fire, police, ambulance and health care including urgent medical treatment)* Public transit vehicles* Commercial transport trucks ‚Äì critical goods and services (food and beverage, health care, safety)* Refrigerated trucks* Potable water delivery/wastewater service* Grocery delivery* Road repair, maintenance and recovery vehicles/tow trucks* Military vehicles* Critical infrastructure, construction and repair vehicles* Home-care workers* Municipal services vehicles* First Nations government services vehicles* BC Ferries/Coast Guard/tugboats/marine emergency/pilot boats* Canada Post and other couriers/package delivery vehicles* Vehicles for the provision of critical government services* Airport authority vehicles and¬†air travel* Waste disposal/recycling* BC Hydro, Fortis and other heavy-duty and light-duty utility vehicles* Telecommunication repair and installation vehicles* Fuel delivery trucks and boats* School buses* Taxis* Agricultural and farm-use vehicles, including vehicles supporting flood response* Veterinarians supporting flood response* Inter-city buses***Defining essential travel, goods and services in B.C.***This order applies to non-essential travel.

First time in BC in the winter,"Hi all, in an effort to clear out some of my outstanding vacation days, I'm looking at a weeklong trip to BC sometime in mid-December. I've been to BC multiple times before (Vancouver, Squamish, Whistler, Kelowna, Victoria, Tofino etc.) but never in the winter.Just wondering what would be the best spots, weather-wise, in mid-December? I was considering Tofino again as I've heard storm-watching in the winter can be really fun. Victoria/Sooke was another choice as I haven't spent a lot of time there.The Sunshine Coast, specifically either Gibsons or Sechelt, is another place I was considering as I've never been there before. Really just looking for a quiet, cozy time with maybe some trails, snowshoeing and skiing (I suppose Whistler would be my destination for that)I'm flying in, for reference, so I will likely be avoiding the flooding situation as well, which I do hope gets better soon.",4,2,0.6,Ask British Columbia,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qxoqo8/best_spots_to_spend_week_in_december_first_time/,19/11/2021 20:25,2021,11,19,canada_flooding

That can be done, and we could even theoretically (ish) create an entirely local food economy using geothermal to create vertical farms.

As we further decarbonize and move local, we'll also start to see why people have pushed for responsible government, and why the neoliberal regime is so toxic for human existence.

197,yes,vancouver,AnEroticTale,Question: Why do we hoard so hard at the slightest uncertainty ?,"Vancouverites have absolutely no sense of community, and will hoard stuff for all sorts of reasons. There. I said it. We as a city seem to have this weird tendency of rushing to grocery stores and supermarkets and going absolutely nuts, cleaning stuff off the shelves like there's a freaking apocalypse happening. I understand this behaviour when Covid hit, I mean there was (is) a worldwide pandemic wreaking havoc and taking lives left and right. You couldn't leave the house, so sure, that deserves a pass.But man, time and time again we have seen this repeat itself. Wildfires? People hoarded water bottles. Covid? People hoarded personal protective equipment for resale. Floods? People are back to hoarding toilet paper, eggs and food in general. Heatwave? People hoarded ACs and Fans to sell on craigslist. Double rainbow? Ok, we didn't hoard anything there, good job :). Aurora Borealis? That never came, but I'm sure someone hoarded binoculars.It just strikes me as odd how we have no sense of community. I was just at Costco yesterday, and people were back to buying 3-4 30 roll packs of toilet paper. Why the hell do you need 120 rolls of TP? I have lived in many cities throughout my life, and have seen floods, wildfires, cold snaps and heat waves. Vancouver has seen all of it  in just the last year alone.  Let's not forget Covid. We didn't have it easy, that's for sure. But I have never seen this much desperation, not even in third world countries.But seriously, let's do better. Take what you need, and maybe a bit extra if things are really grim. Share with people around you. Don't panic buy stuff at the slightest uncertainty. And if you do buy way too much, consider donating it to your local food banks or community service programs. If you are though, someone who hoards stuff to resell, I hope you choke on your toilet paper.",104,55,0.62,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qwzomq/question_why_do_we_hoard_so_hard_at_the_slightest/,18/11/2021 21:09,2021,11,18,canada_flooding

295,no,vancouver,scrumplic,British Columbia floods: Fatalities confirmed near Lillooet as search-and-rescue crews focus on aftermath of mudslides,"(Part 1)A mudslide on a highway in British Columbia has killed multiple people and emergency crews are still searching the debris field south of Lillooet.David MacKenzie, the Pemberton District Search and Rescue manager, said his team found ‚Äúsome fatalities‚Äù in a slide on Highway 99, between Pemberton and Lillooet. Witnesses told emergency officials about 10 vehicles were swept off the road, Mr. MacKenzie said. About seven of those have been located.‚ÄúThere were some fatalities that were discovered,‚Äù Mr. MacKenzie said in an interview. Pemberton District SAR responded to the emergency around noon Monday, with a team of about 24 people. They searched until dark and returned to the site Tuesday.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hopeful to find people alive. But obviously that diminishes with time, the nature of the slide activity. People being caught up in mud and debris, it certainly diminishes as time goes by,‚Äù he said.Mr. MacKenzie would not confirm how many bodies were recovered. Some people caught in the mudslide were able to get out of their vehicles on their ownThe slide is about 42 kilometres south of Lillooet, he said. The highway is also known as Duffey Lake Road.The area near Lillooet is one of two places where search-and-rescue crews were concentrating their efforts on Tuesday after reports from witnesses that mudslides, triggered by a torrent of rain that also caused widespread flooding in the province, pushed cars off highways and down embankments.Canada Task Force 1, an urban search-and-rescue team, finished rescuing people trapped by mudslides on Highway 7 near Agassiz by late Monday. An estimated 140 vehicles containing about 275 people, including 50 children, were stranded.The search-and-rescue task force and Canadian Armed Forces members were expected to enter the slide zone on Tuesday to pull apart debris with heavy equipment and canine units.Emergency officials in Abbotsford, B.C., also announced a new evacuation order Tuesday morning affecting about 1,100 people in a rural area known as Sumas Prairie, just north of the U.S. border. The order applies to a largely rural area dotted by dairy farms and other agricultural operations.Mayor Henry Braun said the Nooksack River on the U.S. side feeds into water systems on the Canadian side. He noted that it‚Äôs moving quickly and water levels rose dramatically over the evening. Mr. Braun said the city does not have enough information from the U.S. side to know when the water will level off.He said more than 80 families have checked into the city‚Äôs reception centre.‚ÄúThis is an uncertain and scary time for people who are affected. They don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening and what the future will be,‚Äù he said at a news conference Tuesday morning.The City of Chilliwack later ordered issued an evacuation order for an area just east of Sumas Prairie.The heavy rain, floods and mudslides happened in a region that was hit by extreme heat over the summer, which fuelled a destructive wildfire season and led to hundreds of deaths. Experts have said this type of severe weather is becoming more common due to climate change. Wildfires can increase the risk of flooding and mudslides.Across B.C. Tuesday, wind and rain warnings have been dropped as the fierce storm moves on.But Dwight Yochim, senior manager for the B.C. Search and Rescue Association, said 79 groups and 3,000 volunteers have been involved in the search-and-rescue operation for the past 48 hours.He said the teams were focusing on getting everyone who was trapped behind landslides down to safety Monday, and those efforts will be expected to carry on Tuesday. He noted the next step would be recovery efforts, including looking at vehicles that were swept over banks.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a lot of difficult challenges coming up. We‚Äôre not even sure who might be missing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere have been reports of individuals that haven‚Äôt shown up yet, and exactly where they might be is going to be the next challenge as some of those reports are coming in.‚ÄùHe said the rescue effort spans from Vancouver Island to the border of Alberta. He noted one big challenge for the teams is simply access to some of the areas affected by flooding or mudslides.Mr. Yochim said his organization, which does not directly do search and rescue but supports the teams that do, never receives calls from subjects; however, in the past two days he has received about a dozen calls from either people that were trapped or the family and friends of people that were stranded.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unusual that my organization ... gets those calls and they don‚Äôt go direct to 9-1-1. So it just shows you the extent of this [event].‚ÄùB.C. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, in an interview with CBC Tuesday morning, brushed aside suggestions that the province did not adequately prepare motorists, residents and municipalities for the degree of severity of the storm that dumped a month‚Äôs worth of winter rains in hours.He said the province has been co-ordinating response with local communities, including in helping set up evacuation centres. More than 20 emergency operations centres have been opened across southern B.C.Mr. Farnworth said the province had given people ample information that a serious weather event was on the way. But those alerts were spread across various advisories, between Drive BC for driving conditions, stream flow advisories to local governments for their communities and general weather warnings.‚ÄúThose warnings and travel advisories are out. You know there was a lot of a lot of warnings that you know there‚Äôs a lot of rain coming and you know what most people stay home. Most people stayed home and the reality is that communities are prepared. The Drive BC site, as I said, is updated on a on a regular basis. People check that they they hear the weather reports. There‚Äôs a lot of warning that takes place,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúEverybody was doing the job that they‚Äôre supposed to do.‚ÄùOn Monday, the entire city of Merritt, a community of about 7,000 people in B.C.‚Äôs Interior located an hour‚Äôs drive southwest of Kamloops, was evacuated due to flooding and damage to the local wastewater treatment plant. Emergency officials told residents to head to Kamloops or Kelowna.Southbound lanes of the Coquihalla Highway, a major connection between the Lower Mainland and B.C.‚Äôs interior communities, were swept away, limiting evacuation routes and disrupting travel throughout the region for the foreseeable future.Environment Canada said between Saturday morning and Monday night, 24 communities across the province received more than 100 millimetres of rain, with Agassiz, Chilliwack, the Coquihalla summit and Squamish topping 200 millimetres. The most rainfall was recorded in Hope, which had 252 millimetres.Abbotsford fire chief Darren Lee said due to the closure of the highway Monday night, about 5,000 cars were stranded. He said Central Valley Search and Rescue co-ordinated with Abbotsford police and fire team and performed numerous rescues along the freeway.Police chief Mike Serr said the rescue effort has been incredibly challenging, with water rising quickly.‚ÄúWe had cars flipped over, a situation where one member had to throw a life jacket and swim out or wade out toward the car that was overturned to bring someone back. ... That was almost on a regular basis for about two hours,‚Äù he said.Mr. Braun said the city‚Äôs priority is to ensure people‚Äôs safety, but he‚Äôs also concerned about the livestock in the poultry industry because Abbotsford is the country‚Äôs top egg-producing jurisdiction.He warned that although the weather has dried up, the challenge for his city remains. He asked the public to prepare for not being able to travel for many days.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over for Abbotsford. That water continues to pour into Sumas Prairie and the waters are rising. That‚Äôs not going to disappear in a day or two. So the freeway is going to be cut off for a while.‚ÄùMotorists stuck bumper-to-bumper on Highway 7 Monday afternoon got a pleasant surprise when workers at Camp Hope on the eastern fringe of the Fraser Valley welcomed them into the religious retreat‚Äôs main lodge for a warm meal and roof over their head that night.",,18,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qvimkd/british_columbia_floods_fatalities_confirmed_near/hkwmxoh/,16/11/2021 21:39,2021,11,16,canada_flooding

I recently moved to Vancouver from Toronto in September this year to attend UBC. I don‚Äôt have family/friends here besides my boyfriend. I was walking home with my boyfriend on Sunday night around 8:30pm when I was hit by a car at the crosswalk. The walk sign was on and I saw the car stop but then it accelerated and hit me on my right side. My boyfriend who was walking to the left of me did not get hit. I felt the tire over half of my right foot and I think the car‚Äôs bumper hit my right thigh. I fell to the ground (not sure if it‚Äôs from the impact or the pain). I was crying because I was in shock and in pain. I was terrified because at that moment I didn‚Äôt know if I could ever walk again.The driver came out of the car and she kept saying she was sorry. I don‚Äôt fully remember the rest of the details besides the ambulance sirens and getting transported to the hospital. Luckily my X-rays came out great (no broken bones our fractures surprisingly). My right leg feels extremely sore and my right foot (especially the sole and heel area) is painful whenever any pressure is applied to it. I would consider myself to be very lucky that I got out of that accident with minor injuries. I‚Äôm a bit terrified of the intersection where the accident happened. I have to cross that same crosswalk every time I go to school/come home from school. Anyways, it‚Äôs been a day and I‚Äôm still in shock and in pain. I‚Äôm not sure how to heal from the pain and trauma. I don‚Äôt really know what to do besides take Advil every few hours. I‚Äôm also finding it hard to fall asleep.

They will become invaluable when calculating your compensation.Otherwise, find a physiotherapist who you are comfortable with. I got recommended the physio shoppe on commercial Dr in Vancouver and the owner, Trevor, was fantastic at his job and helped enormously through the process. Your mileage may vary though, so get other recommendations based on your location and preferences.Focus on the recovery from this first and the compensation second.

Do not depend on your municipal, provincial or federal government to bail you out in the event of a catastrophic event. If we ever encounter a huge earthquake in this region, the first 72 hours is going to be crucial and emergency crews are going to be stretched to the limit with their response. If you don't have the necessary emergency supplies, there's a good chance you're going to be SOL.Also, make sure to get insurance to cover your property and belongings.

Do this every year after your AGM because policies change--especially in the last two years. Does your strata policy cover alternative living arrangements if you're displaced for months or years?

510,yes,vancouver,kpn315,Lower Mainland‚Äôs construction industry near historical lows due to labour shortage and will only get worse,"Via VRCA (Vancouver Regional Construction Association)To meet project demand, the Lower Mainland‚Äôs construction workforce needs to increase by 7,500 skilled trades workers over the next two years. At the same time, it will lose 4,800 to retirement, bringing the total recruitment demand to nearly 12,300 workers. Based on historical trends, we can anticipate that 4,900 new workers under the age of 30 will enter the Lower Mainland industry during this period, leaving a shortfall of nearly 7,300 workers by late 2021. The shortfall is forecast to be nearly 17,500 workers by 2029.The provincial forecast is also troubling: B.C.‚Äôs construction industry will be short 11,700 workers over the next two years and some 23,000 workers short by 2029.Building a sustainable workforce will require the industry to increase recruitment from groups traditionally underrepresented in the current construction labour force, including women, Indigenous workers and new Canadians.Investing in training and apprenticeships is needed to avoid potential skills shortages over the long term, however, it will not address the immediate need for skilled trades workers.To meet the near-term demand for labour, the Lower Mainland needs people tooled up and ready to go now. As such, most near-term labour force needs will likely need to be drawn from outside the province, outside of Canada or outside the industry.[https://www.vrca.ca/advocacy/skilled-labour-shortage/](https://www.vrca.ca/advocacy/skilled-labour-shortage/)",195,187,0.92,Local News,/r/vancouver/comments/qrdw89/lower_mainlands_construction_industry_near/,11/11/2021 5:29,2021,11,11,canada_flooding

In that time my wage went from 14-28$/hr. The work was good the company was good and so were the people. Only problem was I had capped out my hourly until I completed my last year of school. Then I had a new job come around. In the valley, closer to home, union and 43/hr starting. I've had 3 ex coworkers already quit from the previous company in the last 2 months. It's just a matter of wage at this point. Construction companies are multi hundred million dollar companies hell bent on being the cheap fucks from 10-15 years ago. One of the previous owners of my old company owns a helicopter. But lord forbid they fight with inflation .Comstruction contracts for highrise jobs are for the main contractors are close to half a billion dollars and then the sub trades (plumbers, tin basher, sparkies ect) are between 2-8million for 2 years of work. Not to mention that our companies literally rent us out to the main company for 45-60$ an hour and then pay our wage that way so that the company still makes money hourly off of us.

510,no,vancouver,ExcuseGeneral826,Lower Mainland‚Äôs construction industry near historical lows due to labour shortage and will only get worse,"A consortium of contractors are trying to saturate the market with temporary workers - all a ploy to lower wages.Some interesting facts the VRCA has omitted:* There are currently HORDES of illegal workers throughout the construction industry.* It is extremely hard to get a job that pays even just $20/hour for a young inexperienced worker who otherwise works hard and is competent. Remember that construction jobs wear out equipment faster than other jobs: You need to replace your boots and tools at your own cost. A $20 construction job is effectively minimum wage once you factor in wear and tear both on your body and equipment.* Temp agencies are paying $15/hr for HARD work. Showing up at 5:00 am at one ""non-profit"" doesn't guarantee a would-be worker even a full shift at that $15/hr. Never has someone had to work for such low wages (relative to spending power) in a hard construction job in the modern era.* Many very competent tradesmen cannot get into a trades program for the life of them. The reason being that a contractor absolutely cannot let their best guys go for 6 weeks per year in order to take the trades program. You can challenge levels but it's convoluted. In fact the best way to get ticketed is to suck at your job and constantly be on and off EI. Many would-be tradesmen cannot quit their job, cannot get laid off (and if they do, it will be very unexpected), and therefore will never have a chance to get ticketed.* The folk tales about attractive pay rates come with two caveats: Many are 'insider' jobs where the typical person's resume won't even be considered, and many are wages obtained by people who entered the industry and an opportune time (in otherwords, they don't reflect what's achievable for a young worker entering today's construction workforce).* Many contractors are earning very high profits yet paying rock-bottom wages. Other's are disorganized shit shows that somehow earn enough to get by (and likewise, pay the lowest possible wages).* Many contractors are putting out job ads stating they have LMIA's allowing them to take on foreign workers. These same contractors ignore local resumes (in other words, something's fishy with the immigration system here).There seems to be a prevailing trend which isn't simply exclusive to the construction industry: When labour is in high demand, local employers are choosing to import workers instead of raising wages.",,3,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qrdw89/lower_mainlands_construction_industry_near/hk8je8v/,11/11/2021 19:07,2021,11,11,canada_flooding

This formed so close to land and in such shallow waters, that this is being looked at by Environment Canada as a possible Tornado.5. If this is determined to be a Tornado, this is not an EF0. This is an absolute Monster near Wedge, that is extremely rare to see anywhere in Canada, period. (refer to point 3 again just to hammer this home)6.
