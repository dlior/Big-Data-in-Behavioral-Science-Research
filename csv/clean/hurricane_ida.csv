Yes, there was the usual spat of looting and crime that you would expect after an event like this (bad people will be bad) but it was not a mad max free for all. On the whole, people banded together, shared information and resources, and took care of each other. FEMA's response was quick and remarkably coordinated for them (they've improved a lot), and both local and state governments have pushed to provide support as quickly as possible. It is a massive undertaking to coordinate services across multiple layers of government agencies and private sectors. Entergy has done a surprising job of getting power restored (the fact that it failed in the first place due to their negligence and possibly fraud is a bigger issue that will need to be dealt with in the coming months), but their caution in assessing before acting was validated when 2 lineman were killed because they tried to move too fast.The insurance companies need to be taken to task for requiring a mandatory evacuation in a situation that developed too rapidly for that to be possible, but that can be changed through legislative action in the same way that pre-existing condition exemptions were changed.This has been an awful experience for most people, and the aftermath is going to be long and tedious, but I think we can take hope from the way people responded in this crises.

Too many forests had burned, too many heatwaves had killed off too much wildlife and doomed most of the conifer forests west of the Continental Divide. The plague was in its second year, and the prevailing attitude was one of nonchalance‚Äîsometimes called ‚Äúwhistling past the graveyard‚Äù‚Äîtoward the intensity and malevolence of the Delta variant of the SARS-Cov-2 virus and its various spawn in the dark years to follow.A sharper turning point, within the general pivot of 2021 toward what became widely known as the Great Collapse, came at the end of August, as the virus raged throughout the Gulf Coast. The plague spread through its brilliant evolutionary innovation of employing human stupidity as its vector. The human race had, of course, learned of the germ theory of disease more than a century earlier. The previous largest pandemic, of the so-called Spanish Influenza of 1918, was addressed by a medical establishment well versed to looking for microscopic bacteria, even if the existence of a still smaller pathogen eluded them. But in 2021, when the American South began losing control of the Delta variant and unleashing the echo after echo of further variant and immune response, the refusal by the general populace to recognize anything serious about the SARS-CoV-2 virus was as pathological as the Covid-19 disease that resulted from infection. That refusal became a tool of the trade for an ambitious virus on the move.At the end of August, this disregarded and denied microscopic threat met a vicious meteorological one in Hurricane Ida. The power went out, and the ventilators soon ceased their futile gasping against the inevitable. Exhausted medical staff heard of the roofs blowing off hospitals, looked at each other in the darkness of hallways that could not be lit anymore, hearing the wheezes and gasps of patients that had cursed them for their masks and lectured them about dangers of a vaccine that had in fact killed no people at all. They simply could not do it anymore.The initial cracks blown into the foundations of Louisiana‚Äôs medical system grew overnight, as exhaustion and trauma met rage at the absurd waste of it all‚Äîthe ravaged climate that turned Ida into a raging monster, to be followed by too many further storms from a hot Gulf of Mexico, the unnecessary infections and deaths and all the broken bodies that would never be quite the same again.

US infrastructure is already strained including materials for construction that will be needed after the storm, which will delay recovery and is a possible contributor to collapse........>Ida is predicted to track over one of the most critical industrial areas in the U.S.: the industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Not only is the region home to dozens of key petrochemical sites, and crisscrossed by important pipelines, it also has three of the fifteen largest ports in America: the largest bulk cargo port in the world, the Port of South Louisiana, which lies along a 54-mile stretch of the Mississippi River; the nation‚Äôs largest export grain port, the Port of New Orleans; and the Port of Greater Baton Rouge, the nation‚Äôs 10th-largest port. These three ports handle 55-70% of all U.S. grain exports to the world, supplied by barges moving downriver.......>If the ports of the Mississippi River are closed for an extended period of time, the entire U.S. economy suffers, with impacts to the global economy and world food supplies; world food prices, vulnerable to extreme weather shocks, in May of 2021 hit their highest levels since 2011.......>Ida‚Äôs damages to the region‚Äôs transportation infrastructure could well take months to recover from, with key bridges destroyed and hundreds of miles of roads and railroads severely damaged or destroyed. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport could be forced to close for some time: It was heavily damaged by Katrina and closed for 16 days. Likewise, damage to the electrical power distribution system may be widespread and severe, taking weeks or even months for full recovery.>As occurred in the wake of Katrina, lack of electrical service and of labor may be primary factors hindering efforts to resume transportation services.

It seems like reporters when sent to cover a story that turns out not to be gory enough make up their narrative in order to make it seems worse than it was. Same goes for bad weather... Media will find one shed that collapsed or find some construction materials on the ground and photograph the hell out of it just to make it seem horrific.

Do you think so, too?","The IBC (International Building Code) has been accepted and legislated by every state, the military, and some other countries. That Code uses the ASCE 7 (American Society of Civil Engineers) standard that specifies the minimum environmental loadings that should be applied for designing structures. This includes loads from flood waters and wind as well as other loadings. A map of the US is given for wind speeds at every location and the Insurance industry produces flood maps which are used to determine values to be used in design formulas specified in the standard.The maximum wind speed or flood value for any particular location is never known so maximum design wind speeds and flood values are determined based on risk factors. In other words a 5000 year storm COULD occur at any location but the risk is extremely small. Therefore engineers have to strike a balance between the economic value of the structure, the number of lives that might be at risk, and the probability of a storm happening at that rating. For instance in the US, structures are designed for a 700 year wind speed which has a probability of occurring of about 3% over a 50 year life of a structure.Different building codes are issued about 3-6 years apart and in every revision the storm data is evaluated to determine if the values should be changed. So as extreme weather changes to more intense storms your statement that ‚ÄúIt almost seems like Hurricane Ida is making it apparent that our cities were made for kinder climates.‚Äù becomes more relevant and appropriate.Edit: I forgot to add that almost all of my customers are specifying that design values be higher than the minimum.

873,no,climatechange,Kneljoy,Opinion | Hurricane Ida Offers a Glimpse of the Dystopia That‚Äôs Coming for All of Us,"Article:‚ÄúAs a boy, Louis Armstrong worked for the Karnofsky family. The Karnofskys‚Äô tailor shop on South Rampart Street in New Orleans became a second home to him, and the family helped him buy his first cornet. On Sunday night, the Karnofsky building, long neglected by the city and a succession of private owners who promised to restore it, finally collapsed under the force of Hurricane Ida‚Äôs winds.I live in New Orleans, but I saw the news on my phone, as I scrolled from the safety of a rented apartment in Birmingham, Ala. My family and I arrived on Friday. We are among the Louisianans who could afford to evacuate. We got here by driving I-59 to I-20, which is to say, we relied on the comparatively well-funded public infrastructure of interstate highways to get out of harm‚Äôs way.Our less wealthy neighbors rely on streetcars and buses to get around, modes of public transportation that burn less gas and therefore contribute less to the rising seas and stronger storms that imperil us all. But there is limited regional bus or train service around New Orleans, and they largely were left to experience Hurricane Ida, one of the strongest to make landfall in Louisiana‚Äôs history, firsthand.The reports I got from those who stayed, by necessity or obligation, were mixed. My wife‚Äôs cousin, a surgeon at Children‚Äôs Hospital New Orleans, said that for the first time in recent memory, the emergency room was quiet. A doctor friend in Thibodaux, 60 miles southwest of the city, texted to say that a floor of his hospital had lost power and staff were having to manually pump air into the lungs of intubated Covid patients as they moved them to a floor with a working generator. When he got a break, he texted again to say, ‚ÄúI mean this is traumatizing.‚ÄùThe big story, for New Orleans, is that the levees held. This was a huge relief, a vindication of the work the Army Corps of Engineers did to build what it calls a ‚Äúrisk reduction system‚Äù for the city and its suburbs after Hurricane Katrina. Still, the system is less ambitious than the one Louisianans lobbied for after Katrina, and the protection it offers grows weaker every day, as the wetlands that buffer the city from the Gulf of Mexico get wetter.It could not save the Karnofsky building from the wind, it did not prevent the failure of the New Orleans sewer system, and it did not stop the region‚Äôs electrical transmission towers from toppling, leaving the hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the region without power for the foreseeable future. But it kept the Gulf of Mexico out of the city, which was its job.The situation in Thibodaux, LaPlace and other towns east of the city is much worse. In this region along the Mississippi River ‚Äî variously called the petrochemical corridor or Cancer Alley ‚Äî people live with the constant threat of flooding, toxic emissions and other costs of our technological achievement.LaPlace, where a storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain during Hurricane Isaac flooded 7,000 homes in 2012, has long lobbied for flood protection; Congress approved $760 million for a project in 2018. But it isn‚Äôt slated for completion until 2024, and the levees that residents knew would protect them weren‚Äôt anywhere near finished. As I write, there are people there standing in water up to their chests, waiting for rescue.Houma, a city of more than 30,000 people near the coast, endured 150-mile-per-hour winds for hours. So too did many smaller communities, places like Isle de Jean Charles, Cocodrie, Chauvin and Golden Meadow, where Native people and other Louisianans make a life fishing and, often, working for the same oil and gas companies whose pipelines and emissions imperil their homes. Many houses along the coast are built on pilings, 10 feet or more in the air, because floods are so frequent. It is difficult to imagine what might be left. Hurricane Ida‚Äôs lesson, therefore, is not that Louisiana‚Äôs storm protections are good enough. Its lesson is that investments in infrastructure save lives.Nobody in Louisiana needed another hurricane to teach us this. Because of repeated hurricanes and coastal erosion, the population of Cameron Parish, on the state‚Äôs western border, is nearly half what it was in 2000; depending on how you look at it, this is either despite or because of an enormous new liquid natural gas facility in the parish.Many residents of Lake Charles, just north of Cameron, remain in dire straits since last summer‚Äôs Hurricane Laura. Relatively little attention or recovery aid followed that Category 4 hurricane. The Trump administration bears much of the blame for not getting people the resources they need, but it did not help that it is growing ever harder for journalists and citizens to keep up with the floods, storms, wildfires and other dystopian manifestations of our changed climate. That‚Äôs why I worry the attention paid to Louisiana after Hurricane Ida will be short-lived, too.New Orleanians understood why the Biden White House gave Louisiana a D+ on the national ‚Äúinfrastructure report card‚Äù it released in April. With increasing regularity, for example, clouds have been dumping water into our bowl-shaped city faster than our drainage pumps can take it out. Earlier this summer, President Biden came to tour a linchpin of the city‚Äôs water system, called the Carrollton Water Plant, which supplies drinking water to much of New Orleans. ‚ÄúInfrastructure is all about making life livable for ordinary people,‚Äù he said outside the plant, stumping for the infrastructure bill that has since passed the Senate and awaits action in the House of Representatives.A few days after the president‚Äôs visit, a problem in the electrical grid ‚Äî unrelated to the gas shortage that was then vexing much of the South ‚Äî caused a loss of power at the Carrollton Plant, prompting the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board to issue a ‚Äúprecautionary boil water advisory‚Äù for a large section of the city.This too is a familiar problem here. Mostly you hope you hear about the warning before you have made your coffee or brushed your teeth. If you don‚Äôt, you can console yourself knowing that the precautions usually turn out to be unnecessary ‚Äî even if it is hard to shake the fact that not long ago, two people died nearby after drinking water that contained Naegleria fowleri, which is known as the brain-eating amoeba.And even before Hurricane Ida blew through, the city‚Äôs hospitals were filled to capacity.Yet through it all, New Orleanians continue to prove themselves capable of making beautiful moments. From an unfamiliar apartment in Birmingham, I think of Joe Krown playing a piano mounted in the back of a pickup truck or Kermit Ruffins advertising ‚Äúshots for shots‚Äù: a free drink at his Mother-in-Law Lounge to people from the neighborhood who got their Covid vaccine.I think, too, of the brass band staying limber by practicing on the front porch around the corner every week, with my neighbors dancing on the lawn, six feet apart. On a drizzling afternoon this winter, I walked over with my daughter, who was 4 then, just as the band was packing up. She cried because we had missed the music. The trumpeter saw her tears and called for all the instruments to come out of their cases, and the band played her request: ‚ÄúWhat a Wonderful World.‚ÄùThe truth is that it‚Äôs hard to live in Louisiana. The truth is also that it‚Äôs hard to live in many places these days, and Louisiana has the benefit of being comparatively easy to love. In fact, it seems everybody loves New Orleans enough to want to come for a long weekend, because seemingly every block now has an Airbnb ‚Äî or two or three ‚Äî driving up housing costs, especially in neighborhoods on higher ground.Evidently fewer people love New Orleans enough to insist, once they get back home, that their congressional representatives vote for the climate, infrastructure or social welfare legislation that might give this city a few extra decades, or expand the number of people who can make a viable life here, or anywhere else in the United States.Instead, we‚Äôre told to be resilient, which usually means that we should attempt to find individual solutions to our structural problems.Standing in front of the Carrollton Water Plant last May, Mr. Biden joked to reporters, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking up a collection.‚Äù If Louisiana‚Äôs vulnerability were unique, maybe charity would be enough.But if you live near a coast yourself, I counsel solidarity today. Or, for that matter, if you drink water from the public supply, take medicine produced by federally funded research and development, entrust your children to a public school or your parents to a nursing home, or simply enjoy the occasional convenience of a bridge that does not fall, you might take an interest in that infrastructure bill.At $1 trillion, it offers a modest down payment on our collective needs ‚Äî shoring up the roads and bridges like those that my family and I will use to return home whenever the power comes back on and schools reopen.

976,yes,weather,Schmubbs,Coverage of Ida - Reminder: waterspouts and landspouts are tornadoes,"This is a bit of a rant, but regardless: with the coverage of Ida over the past couple days, the risk of tornadoes has been discussed on the Weather Channel, Twitter, etc.  I've seen multiple cases of people talking about Ida producing waterspouts vs. tornadoes, as if they're totally different.By definition, however, [waterspouts](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Waterspout) (and [landspouts](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Landspout)) are tornadoes.  Generally, waterspouts and landspouts are terms used to describe nonsupercell tornadoes - that is, tornadoes that form in the absence of a [mesocyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesocyclone).  The difference between nonsupercell and supercell tornadoes just comes from the processes that result in tornado formation.  Nonsupercell tornadoes, however, are typically (though not always) less intense, smaller, and shorter-lived than their supercell counterparts.To make things more confusing on this subject, some people also refer to any tornado that's over water as a waterspout, regardless of whether or not it's associated with a supercell.  I don't typically do so because I think it further confuses things, but I don't think there's anything really wrong with doing it (though opinions might differ on that topic).  Regardless, drawing a line between a waterspout and a tornado just doesn't make sense, as waterspouts are just a subcategory of tornadoes./endrant",2,4,0.7,,/r/weather/comments/pegz4u/coverage_of_ida_reminder_waterspouts_and/,30/08/2021 12:20,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida
976,no,weather,wazoheat,Coverage of Ida - Reminder: waterspouts and landspouts are tornadoes,"It's an understandable point of confusion...as far as NOAA is concerned waterspouts are *not* considered tornadoes for record-keeping purposes, and tornado warnings are not issued for waterspouts unless they are expected to make landfall. That's probably why this somewhat artificial distinction exists in the public's mind. This is as opposed to places like the UK, where waterspouts *are* counted in tornado statistics regardless of whether they impact land or not.And I'd say that it's not entirely unjustified to keep them as distinct phenomena in the weather reporting/warning sphere. The vast majority of waterspouts reported each year are so-called *fair weather* waterspouts, which typically have wind speeds less than 60 mph and form from far weaker storms than produce tornadoes on land. I was under the impression that even the average landspout is much stronger than the average fair-weather waterspout, so I do not think they are precisely equivalent. I might be wrong though, I can't find any authoritative studies on the subject.",,3,,,/r/weather/comments/pegz4u/coverage_of_ida_reminder_waterspouts_and/hayvi7i/,30/08/2021 19:52,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida

1011,no,weather,contrarymary27,Is it possible for a hurricane to become so big that it could survive interaction with land and traverse the globe (like the red eye of Jupiter)?,I believe the reason why storms like the red eye of Jupiter exist is because there is no land to slow it down or fight the momentum it builds up.  plus the gases on the gas giant are extremely volatile and smaller storms create and feed larger storms and vice versa. Not an expert but this is just some stuff I discovered from looking into it. It is possible for a hurricane to travel farther inland than is general expected but to travel around the whole globe is not possible.

1011,no,weather,atx_sjw,Is it possible for a hurricane to become so big that it could survive interaction with land and traverse the globe (like the red eye of Jupiter)?,"The answer is currently no. It‚Äôs possible for a hurricane to cross land and maintain hurricane strength (ex. Andrew, Wilma - IIRC, etc.), but only if it travels over land for a short time. The longest-lasting hurricane, [Hurricane John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_John_(1994)), lasted a month, traveled over 7,000 miles, and covered a substantial amount of the Pacific. However, it didn‚Äôt interact with any major land masses during its life.It may be possible that hurricanes could be stronger in the future or could be impacted less by interactions with land. I saw an article this morning saying that hurricanes used to lose 75% of their strength within a time period after landfall, but recently the trend is that they only lose 50% of their strength during that time. I haven‚Äôt been able to find that article, but I‚Äôll link it if I find it.",,1,,,/r/weather/comments/pdua8x/is_it_possible_for_a_hurricane_to_become_so_big/haypnj4/,30/08/2021 19:11,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida
