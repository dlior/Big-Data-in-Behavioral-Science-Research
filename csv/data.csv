On the whole, people banded together, shared information and resources, and took care of each other. FEMA's response was quick and remarkably coordinated for them (they've improved a lot), and both local and state governments have pushed to provide support as quickly as possible. It is a massive undertaking to coordinate services across multiple layers of government agencies and private sectors. Entergy has done a surprising job of getting power restored (the fact that it failed in the first place due to their negligence and possibly fraud is a bigger issue that will need to be dealt with in the coming months), but their caution in assessing before acting was validated when 2 lineman were killed because they tried to move too fast.The insurance companies need to be taken to task for requiring a mandatory evacuation in a situation that developed too rapidly for that to be possible, but that can be changed through legislative action in the same way that pre-existing condition exemptions were changed.This has been an awful experience for most people, and the aftermath is going to be long and tedious, but I think we can take hope from the way people responded in this crises.

Too many forests had burned, too many heatwaves had killed off too much wildlife and doomed most of the conifer forests west of the Continental Divide. The plague was in its second year, and the prevailing attitude was one of nonchalance--sometimes called ""whistling past the graveyard""--toward the intensity and malevolence of the Delta variant of the SARS-Cov-2 virus and its various spawn in the dark years to follow.A sharper turning point, within the general pivot of 2021 toward what became widely known as the Great Collapse, came at the end of August, as the virus raged throughout the Gulf Coast. The plague spread through its brilliant evolutionary innovation of employing human stupidity as its vector. The human race had, of course, learned of the germ theory of disease more than a century earlier. The previous largest pandemic, of the so-called Spanish Influenza of 1918, was addressed by a medical establishment well versed to looking for microscopic bacteria, even if the existence of a still smaller pathogen eluded them. But in 2021, when the American South began losing control of the Delta variant and unleashing the echo after echo of further variant and immune response, the refusal by the general populace to recognize anything serious about the SARS-CoV-2 virus was as pathological as the Covid-19 disease that resulted from infection. That refusal became a tool of the trade for an ambitious virus on the move.At the end of August, this disregarded and denied microscopic threat met a vicious meteorological one in Hurricane Ida. The power went out, and the ventilators soon ceased their futile gasping against the inevitable. Exhausted medical staff heard of the roofs blowing off hospitals, looked at each other in the darkness of hallways that could not be lit anymore, hearing the wheezes and gasps of patients that had cursed them for their masks and lectured them about dangers of a vaccine that had in fact killed no people at all. They simply could not do it anymore.The initial cracks blown into the foundations of Louisiana's medical system grew overnight, as exhaustion and trauma met rage at the absurd waste of it all--the ravaged climate that turned Ida into a raging monster, to be followed by too many further storms from a hot Gulf of Mexico, the unnecessary infections and deaths and all the broken bodies that would never be quite the same again. And all for what?We would soon find out the answer to that, with the election and coup of 2022.",0,60,0,,/r/collapse/comments/pe8x3z/power_knocked_out_to_all_of_new_orleans_as/haw06w5/,30/08/2021 3:52,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida

US infrastructure is already strained including materials for construction that will be needed after the storm, which will delay recovery and is a possible contributor to collapse........>Ida is predicted to track over one of the most critical industrial areas in the U.S.: the industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Not only is the region home to dozens of key petrochemical sites, and crisscrossed by important pipelines, it also has three of the fifteen largest ports in America: the largest bulk cargo port in the world, the Port of South Louisiana, which lies along a 54-mile stretch of the Mississippi River; the nation's largest export grain port, the Port of New Orleans; and the Port of Greater Baton Rouge, the nation's 10th-largest port. These three ports handle 55-70% of all U.S. grain exports to the world, supplied by barges moving downriver.......>If the ports of the Mississippi River are closed for an extended period of time, the entire U.S. economy suffers, with impacts to the global economy and world food supplies; world food prices, vulnerable to extreme weather shocks, in May of 2021 hit their highest levels since 2011.......>Ida's damages to the region's transportation infrastructure could well take months to recover from, with key bridges destroyed and hundreds of miles of roads and railroads severely damaged or destroyed. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport could be forced to close for some time: It was heavily damaged by Katrina and closed for 16 days. Likewise, damage to the electrical power distribution system may be widespread and severe, taking weeks or even months for full recovery.>As occurred in the wake of Katrina, lack of electrical service and of labor may be primary factors hindering efforts to resume transportation services.

Do you think so, too?","The IBC (International Building Code) has been accepted and legislated by every state, the military, and some other countries. That Code uses the ASCE 7 (American Society of Civil Engineers) standard that specifies the minimum environmental loadings that should be applied for designing structures. This includes loads from flood waters and wind as well as other loadings. A map of the US is given for wind speeds at every location and the Insurance industry produces flood maps which are used to determine values to be used in design formulas specified in the standard.The maximum wind speed or flood value for any particular location is never known so maximum design wind speeds and flood values are determined based on risk factors. In other words a 5000 year storm COULD occur at any location but the risk is extremely small. Therefore engineers have to strike a balance between the economic value of the structure, the number of lives that might be at risk, and the probability of a storm happening at that rating. For instance in the US, structures are designed for a 700 year wind speed which has a probability of occurring of about 3% over a 50 year life of a structure.Different building codes are issued about 3-6 years apart and in every revision the storm data is evaluated to determine if the values should be changed. So as extreme weather changes to more intense storms your statement that ""It almost seems like Hurricane Ida is making it apparent that our cities were made for kinder climates."" becomes more relevant and appropriate.Edit: I forgot to add that almost all of my customers are specifying that design values be higher than the minimum.

We got here by driving I-59 to I-20, which is to say, we relied on the comparatively well-funded public infrastructure of interstate highways to get out of harm's way.Our less wealthy neighbors rely on streetcars and buses to get around, modes of public transportation that burn less gas and therefore contribute less to the rising seas and stronger storms that imperil us all. But there is limited regional bus or train service around New Orleans, and they largely were left to experience Hurricane Ida, one of the strongest to make landfall in Louisiana's history, firsthand.The reports I got from those who stayed, by necessity or obligation, were mixed. My wife's cousin, a surgeon at Children's Hospital New Orleans, said that for the first time in recent memory, the emergency room was quiet. A doctor friend in Thibodaux, 60 miles southwest of the city, texted to say that a floor of his hospital had lost power and staff were having to manually pump air into the lungs of intubated Covid patients as they moved them to a floor with a working generator. When he got a break, he texted again to say, ""I mean this is traumatizing.""The big story, for New Orleans, is that the levees held. This was a huge relief, a vindication of the work the Army Corps of Engineers did to build what it calls a ""risk reduction system"" for the city and its suburbs after Hurricane Katrina. Still, the system is less ambitious than the one Louisianans lobbied for after Katrina, and the protection it offers grows weaker every day, as the wetlands that buffer the city from the Gulf of Mexico get wetter.It could not save the Karnofsky building from the wind, it did not prevent the failure of the New Orleans sewer system, and it did not stop the region's electrical transmission towers from toppling, leaving the hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the region without power for the foreseeable future. But it kept the Gulf of Mexico out of the city, which was its job.The situation in Thibodaux, LaPlace and other towns east of the city is much worse. In this region along the Mississippi River -- variously called the petrochemical corridor or Cancer Alley -- people live with the constant threat of flooding, toxic emissions and other costs of our technological achievement.LaPlace, where a storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain during Hurricane Isaac flooded 7,000 homes in 2012, has long lobbied for flood protection; Congress approved $760 million for a project in 2018. But it isn't slated for completion until 2024, and the levees that residents knew would protect them weren't anywhere near finished. As I write, there are people there standing in water up to their chests, waiting for rescue.Houma, a city of more than 30,000 people near the coast, endured 150-mile-per-hour winds for hours. So too did many smaller communities, places like Isle de Jean Charles, Cocodrie, Chauvin and Golden Meadow, where Native people and other Louisianans make a life fishing and, often, working for the same oil and gas companies whose pipelines and emissions imperil their homes. Many houses along the coast are built on pilings, 10 feet or more in the air, because floods are so frequent. It is difficult to imagine what might be left. Hurricane Ida's lesson, therefore, is not that Louisiana's storm protections are good enough. Its lesson is that investments in infrastructure save lives.Nobody in Louisiana needed another hurricane to teach us this. Because of repeated hurricanes and coastal erosion, the population of Cameron Parish, on the state's western border, is nearly half what it was in 2000; depending on how you look at it, this is either despite or because of an enormous new liquid natural gas facility in the parish.Many residents of Lake Charles, just north of Cameron, remain in dire straits since last summer's Hurricane Laura. Relatively little attention or recovery aid followed that Category 4 hurricane. The Trump administration bears much of the blame for not getting people the resources they need, but it did not help that it is growing ever harder for journalists and citizens to keep up with the floods, storms, wildfires and other dystopian manifestations of our changed climate. That's why I worry the attention paid to Louisiana after Hurricane Ida will be short-lived, too.New Orleanians understood why the Biden White House gave Louisiana a D+ on the national ""infrastructure report card"" it released in April. With increasing regularity, for example, clouds have been dumping water into our bowl-shaped city faster than our drainage pumps can take it out. Earlier this summer, President Biden came to tour a linchpin of the city's water system, called the Carrollton Water Plant, which supplies drinking water to much of New Orleans. ""Infrastructure is all about making life livable for ordinary people,"" he said outside the plant, stumping for the infrastructure bill that has since passed the Senate and awaits action in the House of Representatives.A few days after the president's visit, a problem in the electrical grid -- unrelated to the gas shortage that was then vexing much of the South -- caused a loss of power at the Carrollton Plant, prompting the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board to issue a ""precautionary boil water advisory"" for a large section of the city.This too is a familiar problem here. Mostly you hope you hear about the warning before you have made your coffee or brushed your teeth. If you don't, you can console yourself knowing that the precautions usually turn out to be unnecessary -- even if it is hard to shake the fact that not long ago, two people died nearby after drinking water that contained Naegleria fowleri, which is known as the brain-eating amoeba.And even before Hurricane Ida blew through, the city's hospitals were filled to capacity.Yet through it all, New Orleanians continue to prove themselves capable of making beautiful moments. From an unfamiliar apartment in Birmingham, I think of Joe Krown playing a piano mounted in the back of a pickup truck or Kermit Ruffins advertising ""shots for shots"": a free drink at his Mother-in-Law Lounge to people from the neighborhood who got their Covid vaccine.I think, too, of the brass band staying limber by practicing on the front porch around the corner every week, with my neighbors dancing on the lawn, six feet apart. On a drizzling afternoon this winter, I walked over with my daughter, who was 4 then, just as the band was packing up. She cried because we had missed the music. The trumpeter saw her tears and called for all the instruments to come out of their cases, and the band played her request: ""What a Wonderful World.""The truth is that it's hard to live in Louisiana. The truth is also that it's hard to live in many places these days, and Louisiana has the benefit of being comparatively easy to love. In fact, it seems everybody loves New Orleans enough to want to come for a long weekend, because seemingly every block now has an Airbnb -- or two or three -- driving up housing costs, especially in neighborhoods on higher ground.Evidently fewer people love New Orleans enough to insist, once they get back home, that their congressional representatives vote for the climate, infrastructure or social welfare legislation that might give this city a few extra decades, or expand the number of people who can make a viable life here, or anywhere else in the United States.Instead, we're told to be resilient, which usually means that we should attempt to find individual solutions to our structural problems.Standing in front of the Carrollton Water Plant last May, Mr. Biden joked to reporters, ""I'm taking up a collection."" If Louisiana's vulnerability were unique, maybe charity would be enough.But if you live near a coast yourself, I counsel solidarity today. Or, for that matter, if you drink water from the public supply, take medicine produced by federally funded research and development, entrust your children to a public school or your parents to a nursing home, or simply enjoy the occasional convenience of a bridge that does not fall, you might take an interest in that infrastructure bill.At $1 trillion, it offers a modest down payment on our collective needs -- shoring up the roads and bridges like those that my family and I will use to return home whenever the power comes back on and schools reopen. Take an interest though, too, in the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package Congress is also considering, which gets a little closer to the scale of the problems before us. Structural problems need structural solutions. Don't give charity to Louisiana because it's unique. Demand that Congress take meaningful action, because Louisiana is not unique, and you may be next.Andy Horowitz (@andydhorowitz), a history professor at Tulane University, is the author of ""Katrina: A History, 1915-2015.""The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Generally, waterspouts and landspouts are terms used to describe nonsupercell tornadoes - that is, tornadoes that form in the absence of a . The difference between nonsupercell and supercell tornadoes just comes from the processes that result in tornado formation. Nonsupercell tornadoes, however, are typically (though not always) less intense, smaller, and shorter-lived than their supercell counterparts.To make things more confusing on this subject, some people also refer to any tornado that's over water as a waterspout, regardless of whether or not it's associated with a supercell. I don't typically do so because I think it further confuses things, but I don't think there's anything really wrong with doing it (though opinions might differ on that topic). Regardless, drawing a line between a waterspout and a tornado just doesn't make sense, as waterspouts are just a subcategory of tornadoes./endrant",2,4,0.7,,/r/weather/comments/pegz4u/coverage_of_ida_reminder_waterspouts_and/,30/08/2021 12:20,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida
1835,976,no,weather,wazoheat,Coverage of Ida - Reminder: waterspouts and landspouts are tornadoes,"It's an understandable point of confusion...as far as NOAA is concerned waterspouts are not considered tornadoes for record-keeping purposes, and tornado warnings are not issued for waterspouts unless they are expected to make landfall. That's probably why this somewhat artificial distinction exists in the public's mind. This is as opposed to places like the UK, where waterspouts are counted in tornado statistics regardless of whether they impact land or not.And I'd say that it's not entirely unjustified to keep them as distinct phenomena in the weather reporting/warning sphere. The vast majority of waterspouts reported each year are so-called fair weather waterspouts, which typically have wind speeds less than 60 mph and form from far weaker storms than produce tornadoes on land. I was under the impression that even the average landspout is much stronger than the average fair-weather waterspout, so I do not think they are precisely equivalent. I might be wrong though, I can't find any authoritative studies on the subject.",0,3,0,,/r/weather/comments/pegz4u/coverage_of_ida_reminder_waterspouts_and/hayvi7i/,30/08/2021 19:52,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida

1939,1011,no,weather,contrarymary27,Is it possible for a hurricane to become so big that it could survive interaction with land and traverse the globe (like the red eye of Jupiter)?,I believe the reason why storms like the red eye of Jupiter exist is because there is no land to slow it down or fight the momentum it builds up. plus the gases on the gas giant are extremely volatile and smaller storms create and feed larger storms and vice versa. Not an expert but this is just some stuff I discovered from looking into it. It is possible for a hurricane to travel farther inland than is general expected but to travel around the whole globe is not possible. If this were to happen we would have had far greater problems leading up to that point.,0,9,0,,/r/weather/comments/pdua8x/is_it_possible_for_a_hurricane_to_become_so_big/hatrt2m/,29/08/2021 17:31,2021,8,29,hurricane_ida

1942,1011,no,weather,atx_sjw,Is it possible for a hurricane to become so big that it could survive interaction with land and traverse the globe (like the red eye of Jupiter)?,"The answer is currently no. It's possible for a hurricane to cross land and maintain hurricane strenh (ex. Andrew, Wilma - IIRC, etc.), but only if it travels over land for a short time. The longest-lasting hurricane, ), lasted a month, traveled over 7,000 miles, and covered a substantial amount of the Pacific. However, it didn't interact with any major land masses during its life.It may be possible that hurricanes could be stronger in the future or could be impacted less by interactions with land. I saw an article this morning saying that hurricanes used to lose 75% of their strenh within a time period after landfall, but recently the trend is that they only lose 50% of their strenh during that time. I haven't been able to find that article, but I'll link it if I find it.",0,1,0,,/r/weather/comments/pdua8x/is_it_possible_for_a_hurricane_to_become_so_big/haypnj4/,30/08/2021 19:11,2021,8,30,hurricane_ida

They found it ""oddly comforting"" and thank you.Happy to receive feedback, suggestions, criticism, etc.Round tripCormorants scream overhead before diving amidst the mud, deep, deep, deep, deep, to find the souls of those so cursed to call this place-- this ground zero of the apocalypse-- home.So many people, but only so many mechanical birds. Burned alive, swept away, crushed by stone, trapped between a hard place and a hard place-- where, Lord, can your people go? Where is left?What will happen when the ""We are with you"" friends, who are far away and foolish, (and careless and pitiless,) need help, too? Who among the burned, scarred, buried will offer them mumbled platitudes? Will the Cormorants come?What harbinger of the end times spreads its greasy, black wings over these wretched people? Where can it take them that it has not already befouled? Rescued from darkness by the source of the eclipse, the damned are moved from shadow, to shadow, to shadow.Each time, they hope to have seen their last of peril, and each time, they learn more of the hard truth, that there is only peril and it will see us out, not the other way 'round.Oh, the comfort of those who believe the world will end in a whimper, lost in allusions to despair and sadness. In my mind's ear all I can hear are bangs: The roar of flames, the crunching of bones, the agonized bellows of animals, and shrill, hypoxic laughter.No whimpers here. Just the hideous howl of a planet consigned to the long drop between the hangman's kick and the end of the rope.",7,21,0.78,Casual Friday,/r/collapse/comments/qxh726/round_trip_a_collapserelated_poem_for_people_in/,19/11/2021 14:20,2021,11,19,canada_flooding

Telling too much, perhaps not justifying itself? Ground zero calling to mind war zones and bombings and disease outbreaks. And does it claim ground zero alone or is it a ""this one of many"" implication. Because my mind went to ""what about Rwanda, Syria, Yemen, Beirut, Pakistan...?"". Maybe the place in the poem is trying to stand for more places than the New Vancouver Island, but the cormorants seemed very place specific. Anyway, I ramble.Mechanical birds? What are you referring to there?Reading again, there are other places I might enjoy trimming. I have imagined cutting out the explanation of what the hard truth is ( ""that there is only peril..."" ). I also imagined ending with ""No whimpers here."". But I don't know, just musings.Lastly, not sure how well the play on ""lost in illusions"" / ""allusions to despair and sadness."" Using "" allusions"" maybe isn't justified enough?But anyway, still beautiful. Bleak and beautiful.

Floodplains flood naturally and forests burn naturally. It is the hubris of man to think otherwise. BC pumped out a lake next to a major river and build a community on it. Obvious that is going to flood. That has nothing to do with capitalism or climate change. It is just 100% stupid. You can't win an argument against mother nature.The real collapse is the coming energy shortage as oil production falls off a cliff from ESG mandates and renewable additions are for much less energy. As well the global food industry is going to be severely damaged from higher oil prices as food production is really a subset of the oil industry. I have a hobby farm and do organic farming, let me tell you the cost of the renewable energy I have and the organic farming is staggering. I'm wealthy and do it for fun and as a prepper to get ready for the low energy future, but my energy and food cost is much higher that what people would think (including time for farming).The key to avoiding collapse is to find a sustainable community (like if you build a house would it be there in 200 years without human intervention) where you can use off grid energy sources (purchased in next two years as skyrocketing demand will make it unattainable), produce much of your own food and that has robust connections to legacy oil and gas to support industry and higher intensity farming for as long as possible. Places lacking this will be cutoff from modern industrialized living. People in major coastal cities are going to be fretting about climate change, buying expensive Teslas while their way of life will become rapidly unaffordable and unstainable thanks to 7% natural decline in O&G production coupled with low investment in new production. Having an electric car won't help them as industrial society runs on oil, gas and coal and will for decades. Already in the US we can see cities being taken over by migrants and homeless. If your energy comes at the end of a major transmission pipeline, you'll be first to get cutoff as supplies dwindle and climate alarmists attack vulnerable rural transmission equipment.NE BC is a particular good location for future sustainability. Vancouver island has good hydro sources and a good growing climate in some regions. No oil for tractors and no gas for heat though.

Vancouverites practice earthquake drills, but we are not prepared for the types of extreme weather events that are hitting the region due to climate change. We had a heat dome this summer which killed hundreds and burned down an entire town. Two bomb cyclones swept through back to back last month. And now this. We hardly have a warning system in place. (No emergency texts, no sirens - the meteorologists and local news only reported on it after the event. Unless you were online, you'd have missed the weather warnings.) And our 911 emergency services are overwhelmed and collapsing (e-comms reporting system overload and staffing shortages; ambulance wait times are hours if you get one at all).The West coast won't be the haven from climate change that people thought.

I was alerted that something was up when I heard thunder yesterday. I opened the blinds and watched several lightening strikes as a very unfamiliar looking cloud system moved past. I know that tornados are exceedingly rare here, but I could see what I thought was a very weak funnel cloud forming. I held a finger against the window as a reference point against the distant clouds to see if I could observe any rotation, and to my surprise I could. I joked with a few people that we might see Vancouver's first major tornado, and everyone brushed it off. Within 10 minutes the system had blown past us out of my line of sight, and then the warnings began rolling in and my instinct was proven correct. I wouldn't say I have climate anxiety, but I have always enjoyed watching the skies. But now seeing the back to back ""unprecedented"" weather events around me, I feel like I almost have a duty to watch the skies. u/hitortabi is 100% correct. Our 911 operators and first responders are in literal collapse. There was just an article this week about the 911 operators that field the majority of calls in the province. They talked about how only years ago, seeing 911 calls hit a 10 second wait time was enough to induce anxiety in them, and now they're regularly seeing minutes long wait times. Pair that with our lack of warning systems, and we're basically a perfect storm for a mass casualty event if/when a major weather event lands anywhere in the Lower Mainland. With the way things are escalating weather wise, it feels like just a matter of time until our province is in the headlines with another ""once in 1000 years"" weather event, except with a higher body count.",0,9,0,,/r/collapse/comments/qof61l/large_funnel_cloud_near_vancouver_canada_prompts/hjoes2c/,11/07/2021 14:40,2021,11,7,canada_flooding

""Provincial, federal and local governments are working with emergency personnel to make sure people and communities get the help they need as they work through yet another natural disaster. This provincial declaration of emergency will ensure the transport of goods, and essential and emergency services."" said Premier John Horgan. ""Thank you to everyone for doing what you can to stay safe and to help one another as we work through this catastrophic time."" Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, made the declaration on Nov. 17, 2021, based on the recommendation from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Emergency Management BC. The declaration will take effect immediately. ""This provincewide declaration will help us with the challenges ahead as we recover from the utter devastation that's been caused by this natural disaster,"" Farnworth said. ""Getting our rail and roadways back up and in operation is a top priority, and the declaration will enable us to put the resources in place to make that happen."" The state of emergency is initially in effect for 14 days and may be extended or rescinded as necessary. The state of emergency applies to the whole province and ensures federal, provincial and local resources can be delivered in a co-ordinated response to protect the public, which remains the provincial government's top priority. ""Our focus is on clearing, repairing and reopening roads to connect the Interior and the North to the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, to get our supply chains moving,"" said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. ""We are working closely with multiple partners to make this happen. It is a big job, but collectively we are up to the challenge and will get things opened up again just as soon as we possibly can."" There are approximately 17,775 people evacuated due to impacts from the flooding, with 5,918 properties on Evacuation Order, and 3,632 properties on Evacuation Alert. The federal government has responded to and accepted British Columbia's requests for assistance. In the coming days, additional federal personnel and resources will be arriving in B.C. to assist. The state of emergency gives agencies, such as the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, Emergency Management BC, the RCMP and others the ability to use extraordinary measures to protect people and communities. https://archive.news.gov.bc.ca/releases/news\_releases\_2020-2024/2021PSSG0073-002190.htm",0,26,0,,/r/canada/comments/qw8v6i/british_columbia_now_under_provincewide_state_of/hl1dwie/,17/11/2021 21:21,2021,11,17,canada_flooding

It's pouring rain.We didn't realize how serious it was until we got to Hope and the Transcanada and Yellowhead were closed. The only way out was the crowsnest pass. As we drove we passed an accident in the opposite lane. The lineup went for tens of kilometers. We now realized we were in the only working highway lane. We got to Princeton as the sun was setting.My wife wanted to stay as we have a 5 month old baby and 13 month old dog. But I wanted to be in a city with resources. So I made the call to drive the 2 hours, in the storming dark, to drive to Kelowna. I was terrified I was making the wrong decision.As we went up Highway 5A we steered around two boulders that were in the middle of the road. As well as three stopped vehicles half in our lane, half on the non-existant shoulder. We eventually caught up with a long train of vehicles led by one slow vehicle (no blame there). The train of vehicles growing behind us.We arrived at the junction of 97C and everyone continued to go to Merritt for the night as it was only a few km away vs. a lot more for Kelowna. My wife (who is American and unfamiliar with the towns and roads) mentioned how scary it is to go in the opposite direction everyone else is going. All I said is, ""every time I've driven through Merritt the weather has been terrible. We can't go there. It won't be safe."" We arrived in Kelowna and honestly it didn't really hit us until a day after at how close we came to being stranded. Every town we visited was devastated up until Kelowna. It felt like we were in an apocalypse movie and we were the only family that made it out.We spent two nights in Kelowna to wait the storm out as we continue onto Edmonton to meet family.

2301,32,no,canada,coffeeinvenice,BC Floods Megathread,"As global warming due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions continue, natural systems that were once relatively stable, measurable and predictable will become increasingly unstable. Developed societies like British Columbia will have to spend more and more time, money, resources, and attention to mitigating the consequences of that instability. But the problem is, climate change-induced natural disasters will not be a one-time thing. Yes, people will clean up after a flood or a typhoon. But the floods and the typhoons are going to happen again. Because the drivers of the natural disasters - human greenhouse gas emissions - have not gone away. Actually, they are just getting stronger.The result for developed civilizations like British Columbia is that more and more resources will be devoted to responding to instabilities and attempting to maintain stabilities that were once gotten for free. Eventually, every developed civilization will start to run out of resources to be able to do so. It's like having a poisonous snake biting a patient's hand, that is continuously injecting venom into the patient's body, and doctors are unable to remove it. They respond by continuously injecting antivenom into the patient. The problem is, even if the antivenom works for a while, eventually you are going to run out of it. And cycling between high venom-high antivenom levels in the bloodstream is eventually going to cause problems in other organs of the body. There will be a positive feedback loop, sometimes in ways that the doctors can't even predict now, that will eventually kill the patient.Some carbonate rock formations in Siberia are now emitting methane as a result of summer heat waves over the past two years.

2322,52,yes,britishcolumbia,Natus_est_in_Suht,"Provincial government prioritizes fuel for essential vehicles, introduces travel restrictions -","TL:DR If you're in the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, Gulf Islands and the Sunshine Coast you can only fill up to a maximum of 30 litres of petrol or diesel at a time. Only essential travel is permitted out of the Lower Mainland using Hwys. 99, 3 and 7. Definitions below. Both orders in effect until December 1st Province prioritizes fuel for essential vehicles, introduces travel restrictionsSource: To help keep people safe and re-establish the movement of critical goods and services following severe flooding and landslides, the Province is taking temporary measures to ensure fuel (gas and diesel) is prioritized for essential vehicles, while keeping it available to British Columbians.Measures to restrict non-essential travel to and from impacted areas are also being introduced.""We are asking people to limit their fuel consumption and vehicle travel at this time and are putting in place orders under the provincial state of emergency to support this,"" said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. ""These steps will keep commercial traffic moving, stabilize our supply chains and make sure everyone gets home safely. We are asking people not to travel through severely affected areas - for their own well-being, but also to make sure the fuel we do have goes toward the services people need in this time of crisis.""Farnworth has issued two new orders using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The first brings in a temporary order to ensure fuel remains available for essential vehicles in affected areas of the province.This order, effective immediately, until Dec. 1, 2021, applies to all fuel suppliers in the Lower Mainland-to-Hope region, the Sea-to-Sky region, Sunshine Coast, the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island.Under this order, essential vehicles will have unrestricted access to fuel as required, using predominately commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations). A full list of these essential vehicles is available in the backgrounder.Non-essential vehicles, including the general public, will still have access to fuel available through retail gas stations. People will be limited to 30 litres per trip to the gas station. The Province will be working with gas retailers and distributors to implement this order to make sure people are not exceeding their allotted limit per trip. As part of this order, gas retailers will be required to ensure remaining gasoline reserves last until Dec. 1, 2021. Anyone who is abusive, threatening or belligerent to gas station workers can be subject to a fine under the order.""When our province is faced with an emergency, British Columbians step up,"" Farnworth said. ""We have a steady supply of gas to support all our essential vehicles and we will get through these restrictions together by staying calm, only buying what we need and looking out for each other. These measures are necessary during temporary shortages as work is under way to re-establish B.C.'s fuel supply.""Under the order, retail gas stations and wholesale distributors will be prohibited from profit-margin price gouging and people will be prohibited from buying gas for the purpose of reselling it.These restrictions will ensure a steady fuel supply to British Columbians, while efforts are undertaken to fix damage to roadways, establish alternative access to fuel through new routes, and re-establishing the flow of fuel through the Transmountain Pipeline that has been offline as a result of the recent weather events.The order does not affect natural gas or heating oil used to heat homes.The second order prohibits non-essential travel along severely affected highways: Highway 99: from the junction of Highway 99 and Lillooet River Road to the BC Hydro Seton Lake Campsite access in Lillooet. Only passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles up to 14,500 kilograms will be permitted. Highway 3: from the junction of Highway 5 and Highway 3 in Hope to the west entrance to Princeton from Highway 3. Highway 7: from the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 9 in Agassiz to the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 1 in Hope.This order will be in effect starting today as these highways start to reopen. It applies to non-essential travel along specific sections of highways between the Lower Mainland and Interior of British Columbia. There are circumstances where travel is essential and permitted, specifically for the movement of any goods that are necessary for the health, safety and well-being of British Columbians. (A full list follows in a backgrounder.) As the backlog of essential traffic clears, restrictions on essential travel can be eased.These measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency, using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The act allows the minister to implement all procedures the minister considers necessary to prevent, respond to or alleviate the effects of an emergency, including controlling or prohibiting travel to or from any area of British Columbia.Essential vehicles definedThe following vehicles will have access to commercial gas stations where available fuel will be prioritized. For vehicles that do not typically access commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations), the Province is working to provide priority access.The groups are defined as: Emergency service vehicles (fire, police, ambulance and health care including urgent medical treatment) Public transit vehicles Commercial transport trucks - critical goods and services (food and beverage, health care, safety) Refrigerated trucks Potable water delivery/wastewater service Grocery delivery Road repair, maintenance and recovery vehicles/tow trucks Military vehicles Critical infrastructure, construction and repair vehicles Home-care workers Municipal services vehicles First Nations government services vehicles BC Ferries/Coast Guard/tugboats/marine emergency/pilot boats Canada Post and other couriers/package delivery vehicles Vehicles for the provision of critical government services Airport authority vehicles and air travel Waste disposal/recycling BC Hydro, Fortis and other heavy-duty and light-duty utility vehicles Telecommunication repair and installation vehicles Fuel delivery trucks and boats School buses Taxis Agricultural and farm-use vehicles, including vehicles supporting flood response Veterinarians supporting flood response Inter-city busesDefining essential travel, goods and services in B.C.This order applies to non-essential travel. It does not apply to: commercially transporting goods transporting essential goods and supplies, specifically: food, water and other beverages fuel and gasoline health-care goods, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies personal hygiene, sanitation and cleaning goods. transporting livestock, agricultural or seafood products and supplies livestock producers returning to a farm to provide care for animals responding to emergencies, including search and rescue operations evacuations for medical reasons and urgent medical treatment highway repair and maintenance transporting essential personnel returning to a person's own principal residence exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right as recognized and affirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.",0,21,0.82,News,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qxstn7/provincial_government_prioritizes_fuel_for/,19/11/2021 23:54,2021,11,19,canada_flooding

First time in BC in the winter,"Hi all, in an effort to clear out some of my outstanding vacation days, I'm looking at a weeklong trip to BC sometime in mid-December. I've been to BC multiple times before (Vancouver, Squamish, Whistler, Kelowna, Victoria, Tofino etc.) but never in the winter.Just wondering what would be the best spots, weather-wise, in mid-December? I was considering Tofino again as I've heard storm-watching in the winter can be really fun. Victoria/Sooke was another choice as I haven't spent a lot of time there.The Sunshine Coast, specifically either Gibsons or Sechelt, is another place I was considering as I've never been there before.

However, oil is just the most common method of transport- we could actually, with higher electric grid usage, replace oil for transport (ish) entirely- for food anyways. That can be done, and we could even theoretically (ish) create an entirely local food economy using geothermal to create vertical farms. What is going to suck though is as we decarbonize our grid is we will come to understand why factories left north America in the first place- the pollution they produce is highly toxic and destructive. As we further decarbonize and move local, we'll also start to see why people have pushed for responsible government, and why the neoliberal regime is so toxic for human existence.

Obviously over the course of the past 48 hours I've had to look into alternative plans.I can't really gather from news reports what the current situation is with regard to major roads on the route to Vancouver from the US. Question: is it possible to drive from the US border to Vancouver? Follow-up question (and please, answer honestly, I won't be offended) is it a good idea to do so?I had thought that maybe if it's not a good plan to drive from WA to Vancouver or if it's discouraged that I could just take the WA-Victoria ferry.

2605,197,yes,vancouver,AnEroticTale,Question: Why do we hoard so hard at the slightest uncertainty ?,"Vancouverites have absolutely no sense of community, and will hoard stuff for all sorts of reasons. There. I said it. We as a city seem to have this weird tendency of rushing to grocery stores and supermarkets and going absolutely nuts, cleaning stuff off the shelves like there's a freaking apocalypse happening. I understand this behaviour when Covid hit, I mean there was (is) a worldwide pandemic wreaking havoc and taking lives left and right. You couldn't leave the house, so sure, that deserves a pass.But man, time and time again we have seen this repeat itself. Wildfires? People hoarded water bottles. Covid? People hoarded personal protective equipment for resale. Floods? People are back to hoarding toilet paper, eggs and food in general. Heatwave? People hoarded ACs and Fans to sell on craigslist. Double rainbow? Ok, we didn't hoard anything there, good job :). Aurora Borealis? That never came, but I'm sure someone hoarded binoculars.It just strikes me as odd how we have no sense of community. I was just at Costco yesterday, and people were back to buying 3-4 30 roll packs of toilet paper. Why the hell do you need 120 rolls of TP? I have lived in many cities throughout my life, and have seen floods, wildfires, cold snaps and heat waves. Vancouver has seen all of it in just the last year alone. Let's not forget Covid. We didn't have it easy, that's for sure. But I have never seen this much desperation, not even in third world countries.But seriously, let's do better. Take what you need, and maybe a bit extra if things are really grim. Share with people around you. Don't panic buy stuff at the slightest uncertainty. And if you do buy way too much, consider donating it to your local food banks or community service programs.

There is a congregation from a Sikh temple in the Lower Mainland who are both preparing meals for people who have been forced to leave their homes, and finding ways of getting these meals safely transported, including helicopters (I think?).

You can turn those feelings into action.

2815,295,no,vancouver,scrumplic,British Columbia floods: Fatalities confirmed near Lillooet as search-and-rescue crews focus on aftermath of mudslides,"(Part 1)A mudslide on a highway in British Columbia has killed multiple people and emergency crews are still searching the debris field south of Lillooet.David MacKenzie, the Pemberton District Search and Rescue manager, said his team found ""some fatalities"" in a slide on Highway 99, between Pemberton and Lillooet. Witnesses told emergency officials about 10 vehicles were swept off the road, Mr. MacKenzie said. About seven of those have been located.""There were some fatalities that were discovered,"" Mr. MacKenzie said in an interview. Pemberton District SAR responded to the emergency around noon Monday, with a team of about 24 people. They searched until dark and returned to the site Tuesday.""We're hopeful to find people alive. But obviously that diminishes with time, the nature of the slide activity. People being caught up in mud and debris, it certainly diminishes as time goes by,"" he said.Mr. MacKenzie would not confirm how many bodies were recovered. Some people caught in the mudslide were able to get out of their vehicles on their ownThe slide is about 42 kilometres south of Lillooet, he said. The highway is also known as Duffey Lake Road.The area near Lillooet is one of two places where search-and-rescue crews were concentrating their efforts on Tuesday after reports from witnesses that mudslides, triggered by a torrent of rain that also caused widespread flooding in the province, pushed cars off highways and down embankments.Canada Task Force 1, an urban search-and-rescue team, finished rescuing people trapped by mudslides on Highway 7 near Agassiz by late Monday. An estimated 140 vehicles containing about 275 people, including 50 children, were stranded.The search-and-rescue task force and Canadian Armed Forces members were expected to enter the slide zone on Tuesday to pull apart debris with heavy equipment and canine units.Emergency officials in Abbotsford, B.C., also announced a new evacuation order Tuesday morning affecting about 1,100 people in a rural area known as Sumas Prairie, just north of the U.S. border. The order applies to a largely rural area dotted by dairy farms and other agricultural operations.Mayor Henry Braun said the Nooksack River on the U.S. side feeds into water systems on the Canadian side. He noted that it's moving quickly and water levels rose dramatically over the evening. Mr. Braun said the city does not have enough information from the U.S. side to know when the water will level off.He said more than 80 families have checked into the city's reception centre.""This is an uncertain and scary time for people who are affected. They don't understand what's happening and what the future will be,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday morning.The City of Chilliwack later ordered issued an evacuation order for an area just east of Sumas Prairie.The heavy rain, floods and mudslides happened in a region that was hit by extreme heat over the summer, which fuelled a destructive wildfire season and led to hundreds of deaths. Experts have said this type of severe weather is becoming more common due to climate change. Wildfires can increase the risk of flooding and mudslides.Across B.C. Tuesday, wind and rain warnings have been dropped as the fierce storm moves on.But Dwight Yochim, senior manager for the B.C. Search and Rescue Association, said 79 groups and 3,000 volunteers have been involved in the search-and-rescue operation for the past 48 hours.He said the teams were focusing on getting everyone who was trapped behind landslides down to safety Monday, and those efforts will be expected to carry on Tuesday. He noted the next step would be recovery efforts, including looking at vehicles that were swept over banks.""There's going to be a lot of difficult challenges coming up. We're not even sure who might be missing,"" he said. ""There have been reports of individuals that haven't shown up yet, and exactly where they might be is going to be the next challenge as some of those reports are coming in.""He said the rescue effort spans from Vancouver Island to the border of Alberta. He noted one big challenge for the teams is simply access to some of the areas affected by flooding or mudslides.Mr. Yochim said his organization, which does not directly do search and rescue but supports the teams that do, never receives calls from subjects; however, in the past two days he has received about a dozen calls from either people that were trapped or the family and friends of people that were stranded.""It's unusual that my organization ... gets those calls and they don't go direct to 9-1-1. So it just shows you the extent of this [event].""B.C. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, in an interview with CBC Tuesday morning, brushed aside suggestions that the province did not adequately prepare motorists, residents and municipalities for the degree of severity of the storm that dumped a month's worth of winter rains in hours.He said the province has been co-ordinating response with local communities, including in helping set up evacuation centres. More than 20 emergency operations centres have been opened across southern B.C.Mr. Farnworth said the province had given people ample information that a serious weather event was on the way. But those alerts were spread across various advisories, between Drive BC for driving conditions, stream flow advisories to local governments for their communities and general weather warnings.""Those warnings and travel advisories are out. You know there was a lot of a lot of warnings that you know there's a lot of rain coming and you know what most people stay home. Most people stayed home and the reality is that communities are prepared. The Drive BC site, as I said, is updated on a on a regular basis. People check that they they hear the weather reports. There's a lot of warning that takes place,"" he said.""Everybody was doing the job that they're supposed to do.""On Monday, the entire city of Merritt, a community of about 7,000 people in B.C.'s Interior located an hour's drive southwest of Kamloops, was evacuated due to flooding and damage to the local wastewater treatment plant. Emergency officials told residents to head to Kamloops or Kelowna.Southbound lanes of the Coquihalla Highway, a major connection between the Lower Mainland and B.C.'s interior communities, were swept away, limiting evacuation routes and disrupting travel throughout the region for the foreseeable future.Environment Canada said between Saturday morning and Monday night, 24 communities across the province received more than 100 millimetres of rain, with Agassiz, Chilliwack, the Coquihalla summit and Squamish topping 200 millimetres. The most rainfall was recorded in Hope, which had 252 millimetres.Abbotsford fire chief Darren Lee said due to the closure of the highway Monday night, about 5,000 cars were stranded. He said Central Valley Search and Rescue co-ordinated with Abbotsford police and fire team and performed numerous rescues along the freeway.Police chief Mike Serr said the rescue effort has been incredibly challenging, with water rising quickly.""We had cars flipped over, a situation where one member had to throw a life jacket and swim out or wade out toward the car that was overturned to bring someone back. ... That was almost on a regular basis for about two hours,"" he said.Mr. Braun said the city's priority is to ensure people's safety, but he's also concerned about the livestock in the poultry industry because Abbotsford is the country's top egg-producing jurisdiction.He warned that although the weather has dried up, the challenge for his city remains. He asked the public to prepare for not being able to travel for many days.""It's not over for Abbotsford. That water continues to pour into Sumas Prairie and the waters are rising. That's not going to disappear in a day or two. So the freeway is going to be cut off for a while.""Motorists stuck bumper-to-bumper on Highway 7 Monday afternoon got a pleasant surprise when workers at Camp Hope on the eastern fringe of the Fraser Valley welcomed them into the religious retreat's main lodge for a warm meal and roof over their head that night.",0,18,0,,/r/vancouver/comments/qvimkd/british_columbia_floods_fatalities_confirmed_near/hkwmxoh/,16/11/2021 21:39,2021,11,16,canada_flooding

2924,318,yes,vancouver,marshmallowpouf,Pedestrian Accident on 41st Ave and West Blvd,"TLDR, i got hit by a car and I'm posting here because I'm not really sure what to do. I recently moved to Vancouver from Toronto in September this year to attend UBC. I don't have family/friends here besides my boyfriend. I was walking home with my boyfriend on Sunday night around 8:30pm when I was hit by a car at the crosswalk. The walk sign was on and I saw the car stop but then it accelerated and hit me on my right side. My boyfriend who was walking to the left of me did not get hit. I felt the tire over half of my right foot and I think the car's bumper hit my right thigh. I fell to the ground (not sure if it's from the impact or the pain). I was crying because I was in shock and in pain. I was terrified because at that moment I didn't know if I could ever walk again.The driver came out of the car and she kept saying she was sorry. I don't fully remember the rest of the details besides the ambulance sirens and getting transported to the hospital. Luckily my X-rays came out great (no broken bones our fractures surprisingly). My right leg feels extremely sore and my right foot (especially the sole and heel area) is painful whenever any pressure is applied to it.

Because you only had soft tissue damage it's not likely you're going to make a bunch of money off this, but ICBC will cover your expenses for physiotherapy etc going forward.Secondly, keep accurate medical records of everything that you need because of this accident. They will become invaluable when calculating your compensation.Otherwise, find a physiotherapist who you are comfortable with. I got recommended the physio shoppe on commercial Dr in Vancouver and the owner, Trevor, was fantastic at his job and helped enormously through the process. Your mileage may vary though, so get other recommendations based on your location and preferences.Focus on the recovery from this first and the compensation second.

Do not depend on your municipal, provincial or federal government to bail you out in the event of a catastrophic event. If we ever encounter a huge earthquake in this region, the first 72 hours is going to be crucial and emergency crews are going to be stretched to the limit with their response.

I moved here from a relatively small country a couple of years ago. My first destination in Canada was in Alberta, I stayed there for a while but was unsuccessful in finding work in my field so I started looking outside. Now I live and work in Vancouver and I'm doing pretty well however:I find the city quite underwhelming, I don't see many events taking place or a lot of activity on meetup and similar sites. I am finding difficulty meeting people, making friends and let alone dating. It's often difficult to find anything happening using google, Facebook, eventbrite, trip advisor or meetup.I don't know what all the people are doing or where are they hanging out, I'm trying to be more social and more out going but it is just challenging. I moved here fairly recently and I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I don't know if this the usual or is it because of the pandemic?Edit: FYI, I do go outside to the gym and I have regular activities planned but these are usually niche and don't attract many.

3267,510,yes,vancouver,kpn315,Lower Mainland's construction industry near historical lows due to labour shortage and will only get worse,"Via VRCA (Vancouver Regional Construction Association)To meet project demand, the Lower Mainland's construction workforce needs to increase by 7,500 skilled trades workers over the next two years. At the same time, it will lose 4,800 to retirement, bringing the total recruitment demand to nearly 12,300 workers. Based on historical trends, we can anticipate that 4,900 new workers under the age of 30 will enter the Lower Mainland industry during this period, leaving a shortfall of nearly 7,300 workers by late 2021. The shortfall is forecast to be nearly 17,500 workers by 2029.The provincial forecast is also troubling: B.C.'s construction industry will be short 11,700 workers over the next two years and some 23,000 workers short by 2029.Building a sustainable workforce will require the industry to increase recruitment from groups traditionally underrepresented in the current construction labour force, including women, Indigenous workers and new Canadians.Investing in training and apprenticeships is needed to avoid potential skills shortages over the long term, however, it will not address the immediate need for skilled trades workers.To meet the near-term demand for labour, the Lower Mainland needs people tooled up and ready to go now. As such, most near-term labour force needs will likely need to be drawn from outside the province, outside of Canada or outside the industry.",195,187,0.92,Local News,/r/vancouver/comments/qrdw89/lower_mainlands_construction_industry_near/,11/11/2021 5:29,2021,11,11,canada_flooding

3282,510,no,vancouver,ExcuseGeneral826,Lower Mainland's construction industry near historical lows due to labour shortage and will only get worse,"A consortium of contractors are trying to saturate the market with temporary workers - all a ploy to lower wages.Some interesting facts the VRCA has omitted: There are currently HORDES of illegal workers throughout the construction industry. It is extremely hard to get a job that pays even just $20/hour for a young inexperienced worker who otherwise works hard and is competent. Remember that construction jobs wear out equipment faster than other jobs: You need to replace your boots and tools at your own cost. A $20 construction job is effectively minimum wage once you factor in wear and tear both on your body and equipment. Temp agencies are paying $15/hr for HARD work. Showing up at 5:00 am at one ""non-profit"" doesn't guarantee a would-be worker even a full shift at that $15/hr. Never has someone had to work for such low wages (relative to spending power) in a hard construction job in the modern era. Many very competent tradesmen cannot get into a trades program for the life of them. The reason being that a contractor absolutely cannot let their best guys go for 6 weeks per year in order to take the trades program. You can challenge levels but it's convoluted. In fact the best way to get ticketed is to suck at your job and constantly be on and off EI. Many would-be tradesmen cannot quit their job, cannot get laid off (and if they do, it will be very unexpected), and therefore will never have a chance to get ticketed. The folk tales about attractive pay rates come with two caveats: Many are 'insider' jobs where the typical person's resume won't even be considered, and many are wages obtained by people who entered the industry and an opportune time (in otherwords, they don't reflect what's achievable for a young worker entering today's construction workforce). Many contractors are earning very high profits yet paying rock-bottom wages. Other's are disorganized shit shows that somehow earn enough to get by (and likewise, pay the lowest possible wages). Many contractors are putting out job ads stating they have LMIA's allowing them to take on foreign workers. These same contractors ignore local resumes (in other words, something's fishy with the immigration system here).There seems to be a prevailing trend which isn't simply exclusive to the construction industry: When labour is in high demand, local employers are choosing to import workers instead of raising wages.",0,3,0,,/r/vancouver/comments/qrdw89/lower_mainlands_construction_industry_near/hk8je8v/,11/11/2021 19:07,2021,11,11,canada_flooding
