Burned alive,  swept away,  crushed by stone,  trapped between a  hard place and a hard place—  where, Lord, can your people go?  Where is left?What will happen when the  “We are with you” friends,  who are far away and foolish,  (and careless and pitiless,)  need help, too?  Who among the burned, scarred, buried  will offer them mumbled platitudes?  Will the Cormorants come?What harbinger of the end times  spreads its greasy, black wings  over these wretched people?

Rescued from darkness  by the source of the eclipse,  the damned are moved from shadow,  to shadow,  to shadow.Each time, they hope to  have seen their last of peril,  and each time, they learn  more of the hard truth, that  there is only peril and  it will see us out,  not the other way ’round.Oh, the comfort of those who  believe the world will end in a whimper,  lost in allusions to  despair and sadness.  In my mind’s ear  all I can hear are bangs:  The roar of flames,  the crunching of bones,  the agonized bellows of animals,  and shrill, hypoxic laughter.No whimpers here.

Telling too much, perhaps not justifying itself?  Ground zero calling to mind war zones and bombings and disease outbreaks.  And does it claim ground zero alone or is it a ""this one of many"" implication.  Because my mind went to ""what about Rwanda, Syria, Yemen, Beirut, Pakistan...?"". Maybe the place  in the poem is trying to stand for more places than the New Vancouver Island, but the cormorants seemed very place specific.  Anyway, I ramble.Mechanical birds?  What are you referring to there?Reading again, there are other places I might enjoy trimming.  I have imagined cutting out the explanation of what the hard truth is ( ""that there is only peril..."" ).  I also imagined ending with ""No whimpers here."". But I don't know, just musings.Lastly, not sure how well the play on ""lost in illusions"" / ""allusions to despair and sadness.""

6,no,collapse,Bow_River,"British Columbia, Canada is getting a Crash Course in Collapse.","People in BC live in floodplains and right next to forests.  Floodplains flood naturally and forests burn naturally.  It is the hubris of man to think otherwise.  BC pumped out a lake next to a major river and build a community on it.  Obvious that is going to flood.  That has nothing to do with capitalism or climate change.  It is just 100% stupid.  You can't win an argument against mother nature.The real collapse is the coming energy shortage as oil production falls off a cliff from ESG mandates and renewable additions are for much less energy.  As well the global food industry is going to be severely damaged from higher oil prices as food production is really a subset of the oil industry.  I have a hobby farm and do organic farming, let me tell you the cost of the renewable energy I have and the organic farming is staggering.  I'm wealthy and do it for fun and as a prepper to get ready for the low energy future, but my energy and food cost is much higher that what people would think (including time for farming).The key to avoiding collapse is to find a sustainable community (like if you build a house would it be there in 200 years without human intervention) where you can use off grid energy sources (purchased in next two years as skyrocketing demand will make it unattainable), produce much of your own food and that has robust connections to legacy oil and gas to support industry and higher intensity farming for as long as possible.  Places lacking this will be cutoff from modern industrialized living.  People in major coastal cities are going to be fretting about climate change, buying expensive Teslas while their way of life will become rapidly unaffordable and unstainable thanks to 7% natural decline in O&G production coupled with low investment in new production.  Having an electric car won't help them as industrial society runs on oil, gas and coal and will for decades.  Already in the US we can see cities being taken over by migrants and homeless.  If your energy comes at the end of a major transmission pipeline, you'll be first to get cutoff as supplies dwindle and climate alarmists attack vulnerable rural transmission equipment.NE BC is a particular good location for future sustainability.  Vancouver island has good hydro sources and a good growing climate in some regions.  No oil for tractors and no gas for heat though.

The City of Abbotsford issued [an evacuation order for this area last night](https://twitter.com/City_Abbotsford/status/1460813262342148103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1460813262342148103%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvancouversun.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fbreaking-news-catastrophic-flood-warning-issued-as-pump-failure-leads-to-fraser-river-flooding).The article is quite detailed and explanatory, so I've quoted it in full below, with my emphasis in bold:>**David Carrigg - Catastrophic flood warning issued for Sumas Prairie as pump system set to fail**  >  >*Tens of thousands of dairy cows at risk of drowning and hundreds of thousands of chickens*  >  >\-  >  >**The Fraser River was predicted to flood into the Sumas Prairie and surrounding areas on Tuesday night, potentially leading to catastrophic damage, significant risk to human life and devastation of livestock.**  >  >**“This event is anticipated to be catastrophic. Residents who cannot evacuate safely are asked to call 911 and report your location immediately,” said B.C.’s Public Safety Minister, in a statement issued shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday.**  >  >**“If you are in the Sumas Prairie and have not already evacuated, you must do so immediately. Do not stay for livestock or property. Flood conditions have escalated quickly and pose a significant risk to life.”**  >  >**City of Abbotsford mayor Henry Braun made an urgent call at 8 p.m. for all people to immediately evacuate the area. That included hundreds of farmers who had stayed back to take care of their livestock and birds after an evacuation order earlier because of initial flooding caused by an overflowing river just south of the border.**  >  >The city has a news conference planned for 7:30 a.m.  >  >“I know it’s hard for farmers to leave their life’s work. But lives are more important to me right now than livestock and chickens,” Braun said.  >  >**Fraser Valley farmers supply 50 per cent of all B.C.’s eggs, chickens and dairy products. There are 45,000 dairy cows in the valley, and each chicken farm has around 25,000 birds.**  >  >**The reason for the urgent announcement was the imminent failure of the key Barrowtown Pump Station — a four-pump station that keeps the Fraser River out of the Sumas Lake Canal and protects many square kilometres of prime agricultural land.**  >  >**Abbotsford Fire Rescue Service Chief Darren Lee said that sandbags were being placed around the pump station to buy time and that smaller pumps were being flown in to beef up the station. All four pumps were working, but they were unable to stop the rise of the water in the canal and once water got into the pumping station, he said, the pumps would fail.**  >  >If the pumps do fail, an emergency broadcast will be made to residents of Abbotsford and Chilliwack by text message.  >  >In Farnworth’s late evening statement, he said he has been contact with Braun and that Emergency Management BC is ready to issue a broadcast intrusive alert through the Alert Ready system.  >  >However, he said the city has indicated that it does not want to issue an alert at this time.  >  >Lee said that swift water rescue assets were being sent to the area so that at first light they could be used if people were stranded by rising water. Once the pump station fails, the water level was expected to reach around 10 feet (three metres) in the prairie — which could take from two to seven days.  >  >**“With the failure of this key piece of infrastructure, water within the Sumas Prairie will not be able to be pumped out and water from the Fraser River will begin entering the already flooded Sumas Prairie area,” the City of Abbotsford wrote in a prepared statement telling people to leave the area.**  >  >**The event is anticipated to be catastrophic. The City of Abbotsford has shut off domestic water service to the area.**  >  >In the city’s warning to remaining residents to get out fast, it states there is a “significant risk to life.”  >  >Braun said that he spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and B.C. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth on Tuesday night and they had promised to provide pumps and other equipment and help in any way they could.  >  >In a statement issued late Tuesday night Farnworth echoed Braun’s plea to residents to get to safety right away.  >  >“If you are in the Sumas Prairie and have not already evacuated, you must do so immediately. Do not stay for livestock or property. Flood conditions have escalated quickly and pose a significant risk to life,” he said in the statement. “This event is anticipated to be catastrophic. Residents who cannot evacuate safely are asked to call 911 and report your location immediately.”  >  >Farnworth also said that the province is providing the City of Abbotsford with any resources it needs.  >  >“I have also been in contact with Bill Blair, federal Minister of Emergency Preparedness, to request federal assistance on this incident and the flooding situation in general. This includes Canadian Armed Forces ground and air support,” Farnworth added.  >  >**According to** **a 2013 report written by City of Abbotsford staff** \[*edit: anyone have the Council report link?*\] **seeking money to upgrade the electrical system in the Barrowtown facility (built between 1977 and 1983), if the station fails it will result in around $500 million in damages and impact “major transportation and utility corridors such as Highway 11, 1, railways and underground gas/oil lines.**”  >  >**“Major flooding in the area would significantly impact food producers and food processing companies, and cause job losses which typically takes 5-10 years to recover,” the report stated. There are about 1,400 farms in the Sumas Prairie.**  >  >**The last time a major flood event occurred in the Fraser River was in May 1948 when 16,000 people were forced from their homes and 220 square kilometres of land ended up under water.

15,no,collapse,SebWilms2002,Large funnel cloud near Vancouver (Canada) prompts tornado watch,"I have a nearly unbroken view of the horizon from where I live, and love watching the clouds. I was alerted that something was up when I heard thunder yesterday. I opened the blinds and watched several lightening strikes as a very unfamiliar looking cloud system moved past. I know that tornados are exceedingly rare here, but I could see what I thought was a very weak funnel cloud forming. I held a finger against the window as a reference point against the distant clouds to see if I could observe any rotation, and to my surprise I could. I joked with a few people that we might see Vancouver's first major tornado, and everyone brushed it off. Within 10 minutes the system had blown past us out of my line of sight, and then the warnings began rolling in and my instinct was proven correct. I wouldn't say I have climate anxiety, but I have always enjoyed watching the skies. But now seeing the back to back ""unprecedented"" weather events around me, I feel like I almost have a duty to watch the skies. u/hitortabi is 100% correct. Our 911 operators and first responders are in literal collapse. There was just an article this week about the 911 operators that field the majority of calls in the province. They talked about how only years ago, seeing 911 calls hit a 10 second wait time was enough to induce anxiety in them, and now they're regularly seeing minutes long wait times. Pair that with our lack of warning systems, and we're basically a perfect storm for a mass casualty event if/when a major weather event lands anywhere in the Lower Mainland. With the way things are escalating weather wise, it feels like just a matter of time until our province is in the headlines with another ""once in 1000 years"" weather event, except with a higher body count.",,9,,,/r/collapse/comments/qof61l/large_funnel_cloud_near_vancouver_canada_prompts/hjoes2c/,2021-11-07 14:40:55,2021,11,7

This provincial declaration of emergency will ensure the transport of goods, and essential and emergency services.” said Premier John Horgan. “Thank you to everyone for doing what you can to stay safe and to help one another as we work through this catastrophic time.”    Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, made the declaration on Nov. 17, 2021, based on the recommendation from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Emergency Management BC. The declaration will take effect immediately.    “This provincewide declaration will help us with the challenges ahead as we recover from the utter devastation that’s been caused by this natural disaster,” Farnworth said. “Getting our rail and roadways back up and in operation is a top priority, and the declaration will enable us to put the resources in place to make that happen.”    The state of emergency is initially in effect for 14 days and may be extended or rescinded as necessary. The state of emergency applies to the whole province and ensures federal, provincial and local resources can be delivered in a co-ordinated response to protect the public, which remains the provincial government's top priority.    “Our focus is on clearing, repairing and reopening roads to connect the Interior and the North to the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, to get our supply chains moving,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We are working closely with multiple partners to make this happen. It is a big job, but collectively we are up to the challenge and will get things opened up again just as soon as we possibly can.”    There are approximately 17,775 people evacuated due to impacts from the flooding, with 5,918 properties on Evacuation Order, and 3,632 properties on Evacuation Alert.    The federal government has responded to and accepted British Columbia’s requests for assistance. In the coming days, additional federal personnel and resources will be arriving in B.C. to assist.    The state of emergency gives agencies, such as the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, Emergency Management BC, the RCMP and others the ability to use extraordinary measures to protect people and communities.  https://archive.news.gov.bc.ca/releases/news\_releases\_2020-2024/2021PSSG0073-002190.htm",,26,,,/r/canada/comments/qw8v6i/british_columbia_now_under_provincewide_state_of/hl1dwie/,2021-11-17 21:21:12,2021,11,17

32,no,canada,aeo1us,BC Floods Megathread,"My family and I left Washington State on Sunday. I'm Canadian and haven't been to Canada in 20 months. We entered Canada at the Abbotsford crossing. It's pouring rain.We didn't realize how serious it was until we got to Hope and the Transcanada and Yellowhead were closed. The only way out was the crowsnest pass. As we drove we passed an accident in the opposite lane. The lineup went for tens of kilometers. We now realized we were in the only working highway lane. We got to Princeton as the sun was setting.My wife wanted to stay as we have a 5 month old baby and 13 month old dog. But I wanted to be in a city with resources. So I made the call to drive the 2 hours, in the storming dark, to drive to Kelowna. I was terrified I was making the wrong decision.As we went up Highway 5A we steered around two boulders that were in the middle of the road. As well as three stopped vehicles half in our lane, half on the non-existant shoulder. We eventually caught up with a long train of vehicles led by one slow vehicle (no blame there). The train of vehicles growing behind us.We arrived at the junction of 97C and *everyone* continued to go to Merritt for the night as it was only a few km away vs. a lot more for Kelowna. My wife (who is American and unfamiliar with the towns and roads) mentioned how scary it is to go in the opposite direction everyone else is going. All I said is, ""every time I've driven through Merritt the weather has been terrible. We can't go there. It won't be safe."" We arrived in Kelowna and honestly it didn't really hit us until a day after at how close we came to being stranded. Every town we visited was devastated up until Kelowna. It felt like we were in an apocalypse movie and we were the only family that made it out.We spent two nights in Kelowna to wait the storm out as we continue  onto Edmonton to meet family. I write this from Invermere. We'll wait here another night if we need to.Update: Made it to Edmonton safe!",,92,,,/r/canada/comments/qvrbdb/bc_floods_megathread/hl00lxq/,2021-11-17 15:55:47,2021,11,17

Several hundred thousand acres are about to be submerged beneath raging floodwaters, with no way to drain them.This isn't the exciting thing, though. Nor is that every road and rail link out of the lower mainland is destroyed with no date of re-opening.

But the floods and the typhoons are going to happen again. Because the drivers of the natural disasters - human greenhouse gas emissions - have not gone away. Actually, they are just getting stronger.The result for developed civilizations like British Columbia is that more and more resources will be devoted to responding to instabilities and attempting to maintain stabilities that were once gotten for free. Eventually, every developed civilization will start to run out of resources to be able to do so. It's like having a poisonous snake biting a patient's hand, that is continuously injecting venom into the patient's body, and doctors are unable to remove it. They respond by continuously injecting antivenom into the patient. The problem is, even if the antivenom works for a while, eventually you are going to run out of it. And cycling between high venom-high antivenom levels in the bloodstream is eventually going to cause problems in other organs of the body. There will be a positive feedback loop, sometimes in ways that the doctors can't even predict now, that will eventually kill the patient.Some carbonate rock formations in Siberia are now emitting methane as a result of summer heat waves over the past two years. Something I've never heard of before and I don't think any scientist ever foresaw happening. It was/is an unknown unknown. And more of them will emerge as the climate crisis gets worse.",,15,,,/r/canada/comments/qvrbdb/bc_floods_megathread/hl97dmi/,2021-11-19 14:03:43,2021,11,19

37,no,canada,est1-9-8-4,Vancouver is now completely cut off from the rest of Canada by road,"Devils advocate here and alternative perspective/thought experiment:Canada has artificially inflated the forests’ trees canopy by planting more trees (I did this as a Boy Scout and do it for work too once in a blue moon!) however This excess’ tree canopy is assisting in making forest fires more intense…there is more fuel for the fire to grow. So we plant trees for slope stabilization but this increase density also makes for a more intense fire when it does occur.Additional tree canopy also means more moisture is being absorbed by this bio mass. More water retention means more water is also released into the atmosphere, inadvertently creating more intense storms.The big enemy Global warming means growing season is extended, so the artificially introduced excess of tree canopy is also growing at a more intense rate, increasing the effects of forest fires and rainfall. Now Thinning out the tree canopy is probably a more responsible practice then clear cutting…however doing this means less of nature is left ‘’untouched’. Also how does one even figure out the property tree canopy density?Clear cutting may look terrible but it can be utilized to create rings of protection, similar to how people burn forest around their homes so by the time the fire reaches their property there is no more fuel to burn.So when countries partner up to swap carbon footprint points ie. country X ravishes their land to mine, or do fracking etc but then offset it by planting trees somewhere in Canada….it looks good on paper (net effect is positive) but it may not be a solution at all.Cheers",,-10,,,/r/canada/comments/qurhay/vancouver_is_now_completely_cut_off_from_the_rest/hksylky/,2021-11-16 02:39:30,2021,11,16

Both orders in effect until December 1st** ***Province prioritizes fuel for essential vehicles, introduces travel restrictions***Source:  [https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021EMBC0073-002212](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021EMBC0073-002212)To help keep people safe and re-establish the movement of critical goods and services following severe flooding and landslides, the Province is taking temporary measures to ensure fuel (gas and diesel) is prioritized for essential vehicles, while keeping it available to British Columbians.Measures to restrict non-essential travel to and from impacted areas are also being introduced.“We are asking people to limit their fuel consumption and vehicle travel at this time and are putting in place orders under the provincial state of emergency to support this,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “These steps will keep commercial traffic moving, stabilize our supply chains and make sure everyone gets home safely. We are asking people not to travel through severely affected areas – for their own well-being, but also to make sure the fuel we do have goes toward the services people need in this time of crisis.”Farnworth has issued two new orders using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The first brings in a temporary order to ensure fuel remains available for essential vehicles in affected areas of the province.This order, effective immediately, until Dec. 1, 2021, applies to all fuel suppliers in the Lower Mainland-to-Hope region, the Sea-to-Sky region, Sunshine Coast, the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island.Under this order, essential vehicles will have unrestricted access to fuel as required, using predominately commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations). A full list of these essential vehicles is available in the backgrounder.Non-essential vehicles, including the general public, will still have access to fuel available through retail gas stations. People will be limited to 30 litres per trip to the gas station. The Province will be working with gas retailers and distributors to implement this order to make sure people are not exceeding their allotted limit per trip. As part of this order, gas retailers will be required to ensure remaining gasoline reserves last until Dec. 1, 2021. Anyone who is abusive, threatening or belligerent to gas station workers can be subject to a fine under the order.“When our province is faced with an emergency, British Columbians step up,” Farnworth said. “We have a steady supply of gas to support all our essential vehicles and we will get through these restrictions together by staying calm, only buying what we need and looking out for each other. These measures are necessary during temporary shortages as work is under way to re-establish B.C.’s fuel supply.”Under the order, retail gas stations and wholesale distributors will be prohibited from profit-margin price gouging and people will be prohibited from buying gas for the purpose of reselling it.These restrictions will ensure a steady fuel supply to British Columbians, while efforts are undertaken to fix damage to roadways, establish alternative access to fuel through new routes, and re-establishing the flow of fuel through the Transmountain Pipeline that has been offline as a result of the recent weather events.The order does not affect natural gas or heating oil used to heat homes.The second order prohibits non-essential travel along severely affected highways:* Highway 99: from the junction of Highway 99 and Lillooet River Road to the BC Hydro Seton Lake Campsite access in Lillooet. Only passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles up to 14,500 kilograms will be permitted.* Highway 3: from the junction of Highway 5 and Highway 3 in Hope to the west entrance to Princeton from Highway 3.* Highway 7: from the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 9 in Agassiz to the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 1 in Hope.This order will be in effect starting today as these highways start to reopen. It applies to non-essential travel along specific sections of highways between the Lower Mainland and Interior of British Columbia. There are circumstances where travel is essential and permitted, specifically for the movement of any goods that are necessary for the health, safety and well-being of British Columbians.

59,yes,britishcolumbia,Misterdoctordoom,In response part 2,"Hello again. since the first post brought up a lot of decent discussion I thought id do a second part using some of the requests from the post. also I would like to reiterate that im not trying to hurt anyones feelings or bash a place but these are my opinions based on long term visits to these places mostly due to working in the communities. Also I know my formatting sucks. anyways, here we go.I will break down each community by four criteria.1. apparent crime and or social issues2. work opportunity3. outdoors4. shopping/ restaurants/amenities5. housing opportunity6. general vibe.1- Williams lake1. willies puddle has all the typical trappings of a northern bc logging town. a too large focus on wood for its economy. homelessness and racial issues make the town generally feel more unwelcoming that it is.2. decent amount of blue collar work in the small community but not overwhelming prosperity.3. williams lake may be the best place to mountain bike and hike you have never considered. hundreds of kms of trails that are well loved and curated. lots of hunting and fishing and rivers and lakes to explore. the weather is generally pretty great year round.4. a few cute shops around town and the typical shopping areas associated with a town of around 10k. no airport. red tomato pies is the best pizza in bc hands down.5. reasonable rent and house prices. often see houses being built all a long the lake.6. kind of a shit kicker town but I like it. I take my bike there for work 10+ times a year and ride till its dark.2- Chetwynd1. so this town has it all for a small community. petty theft, domestic abuse, abnormally high major crime. etc. im exaggerating but not by much.2. lots of work but it seems to be slowing down. reliance on wood and gas with very little diversification.3. absolutely beautiful outdoors, powder king is one of the best ski hills in bc. lots of opportunities for backcountry exploration. 4. i hope you like amazon and family style restaurants. 5. obscenely expensive houses and surprisingly little being built. its like they know its going to bust.6. my least favourite town in bc. no sense of pride. dirty and nothing to do but sled and ski. too far from anywhere. cold as hell and windy in the winter. awful.3- vancouver (gva)   1 i mean, come on this is the big city, you have an assortment of social issues associated with it. i         guess whats unique is the layout makes it a nightmare to travel around in. lots of housing issues and homelessness and drug use in the hastings area.   2 if you want to chase a white collar life vancouver has a ton of opportunity. i will say that some of my co workers in the suburbs have a hard time finding stable work but thats pretty anecdotal. 3 north shore, the ocean, rivers lakes and ski meccas within a hour and a half. this is the place to be if you like outdoors and can afford a vehicle to get there. if you want to step out your door into nature you better have the cash.4 if you dont like your options here i dont know what to tell you. its top tier in food, shopping and events. 5 yikes, this is where it is a huge issue. ranked the least affordable city in north american and it shows. if you move there and dont have a fantastic job or were born with an inheritance its a compete nightmare of house poverty, commuting and renting for life.6 i love to visit. but when im working there im constantly wound up due to traffic and people overload. the views and ability to take in a show or go for a hike is amazing but i always find people that i visit down there are always hamstrung by bills and obligations which leads me to wonder why they live there at all.4-haida gwaii(north and sound islands)1 quite a lot of alcoholism on the island. and a sense of combativeness between the logging groups and the indigenous population are a slight mark on an otherwise peaceful place.2 not much work at all and you can see it all over. as logging slows down and isnt as welcome on the island they havent made much effort to pivot to new frontiers.3 oh man. this place is a postcard at every turn. get a boat and learn how to properly navigate and its secrets will keep you busy for a lifetime exploring. 4 due to a bit of tourism there are cute as hell lodging and bnbs, nice little restaurants and shops, but nothing at all in the way of big shopping. amenities tend to be extremely expensive due to how hard it is to get there.5 im not really sure to be honest. its been a few years since ive been there. but i didnt see much in the way of new construction or rentals. a lot of older houses around. 6 a paradise for someone who just wants to live a quiet life and has some money to accommodate that. i couldnt imagine trying to raise a family on the island. ive considered on a number of occasions buying a little plot of land and building a cabin to visit. love it there.thanks for reading. i hope everyone affected but the flooding and washouts are safe. happy friday.",8,15,0.86,Discussion,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qxivt5/in_response_part_2/,2021-11-19 15:42:39,2021,11,19

However, oil is just the most common method of transport- we could actually, with higher electric grid usage, replace oil for transport (ish) entirely- for food anyways. That can be done, and we could even theoretically (ish) create an entirely local food economy using geothermal to create vertical farms. What is going to suck though is as we decarbonize our grid is we will come to understand why factories left north America in the first place- the pollution they produce is highly toxic and destructive. As we further decarbonize and move local, we'll also start to see why people have pushed for responsible government, and why the neoliberal regime is so toxic for human existence.

If China or other countries destroys whole ecosystems and water ways mining lithium and other materials for our EV's, then what? It is like switching to an electric lawn mower to be green while at the same time throwing your perfectly good lawnmower in the garbage and taking your jerry can of extra fuel and engine oil and pouring them into a drain. But no carbon was released right?BC Ferries are moving to LNG and there should be a push to move BC's commercial fleets and even civilian vehicles to LNG.

Hi - American friend here. I had been planning to drive from California up the coast and enter Canada on Monday to visit Vancouver, then down to Victoria and back to WA on the ferries. Obviously over the course of the past 48 hours I've had to look into alternative plans.I can't really gather from news reports what the current situation is with regard to major roads on the route to Vancouver from the US. Question: is it possible to drive from the US border to Vancouver? Follow-up question (and please, answer honestly, I won't be offended) is it a good idea to do so?I had thought that maybe if it's not a good plan to drive from WA to Vancouver or if it's discouraged that I could just take the WA-Victoria ferry.

""Alert Ready"" seems useless; no alerts for BC in 2021","I've been looking at which mobile app(s) to download to be notified of emergencies, prompted by the current emergency that our province is going through, plus this summer's heat dome, wildfires, and air quality issues.I've searched the App Store (iOS) for an official BC emergency alert app but couldn't find one. Either it doesn't exist, or it didn't show up in the results. I then ended up stumbling across the [Alert Ready](https://www.alertready.ca/index.html) site. According to their site:*""Alert Ready is Canada’s emergency alerting system. Alert Ready delivers* ***critical and potentially life-saving alerts*** *to Canadians through television, radio and LTE-connected and compatible wireless devices. The Alert Ready system was developed with many partners, including federal,* ***provincial*** *and territorial emergency management officials,* ***Environment and Climate Change Canada,*** *Pelmorex, the broadcasting industry and wireless service providers.""*As of October 27 there were no alerts issued by the system for British Columbia in 2021. None (see image). The Alert Ready system is supposed to issue alerts for wildfires, forest fires, air quality, landslides, storm surges, and many other emergencies. (See second image). Ironically, an Alert Ready test supposedly went out yesterday (11.17). I never received it (my phone was on Do Not Disturb and the system doesn't bypass that).I'm listening to a replay of the press conference with Premier Horgan and BC Public Safety Minister Farnworth; questions were asked about why the Alert Ready system wasn't utilized. (Sidenote: It certainly looked like Farnworth got testy when pressed about the alert system, didn't it?)So, my question is... what gives? Is this system useless? What apps / systems should we be using instead as an alert system? Farnworth justified the lack of alerts by saying that Alert Ready is triggered only when individual regions / municipalities ask for it. But ZERO alerts for 2021? C'mon...TL;DR: Alert Ready system is supposed to alert people about emergencies such as natural disasters, no alerts were issued for BC in 2021 as of October 27.

It also would have been useful for people not on social media when major changes to covid policy took place (no travel for example).And I'd say the massive amount of rain and flooding warranted an alert as much as a tsunami might on the coast. There are hundreds of people stranded and a warning could have kept people off the roads or convinced them to get home before the storm. Yes, individual regions have their own alert systems but, for example, here in Nanaimo it's an app. I think you can set it up for a phone number too but that requires effort. The provincial system doesn't require opt-in. They have the system and they're afraid to use it. It's like they're worried we won't listen when something huge happens.

We don't have any friends or family in Pemberton and although they have a robust emergency bag in the truck with them, it doesn't have any spare $$ near what it costs for what they need for an unexpected and extended stay in a place they aren't familiar with. (I would be hard-pressed to find ANYONE that leaves $500.00+ in an emergency bag actually) My family is already on a tight budget, so yeah, this is kind of stressful. The cost of living in Pemberton is already incredibly high and so this was putting a great amount of pressure on them.And then the Red Cross was suddenly there.Grocery vouchers for everyone stranded, a new motel room with a kitchen (cooking is cheaper than eating out) and a much better bed to help with the post-op surgery healing, a gas card, the whole 9 yards. Now their focus is back on making it home safely, like it should be. Also thank you to any kind Pemberton residents helping those stranded in any way. (There are apparently a lot of truckers up there too so I know this is a stressful time for everyone, and RIP to those we've lost in the slide near Lillooet.) So yes, anyway...The Red Cross is an *amazing* organization, I would suggest (to those who CAN) donating whatever amount you can afford ASAP, and if anyone from the Red Cross reads this... Please know that some families out there are incredibly grateful for the help/assistance you provide in times like this. Something happens and you guys are **just there.**&#x200B;To anyone stranded or stopped right now, I wish you all the best, really. It's a very unpleasant experience and it's a scary one, but people seem to be coming together over it too. There are some really beautiful and gracious residents of Pemberton helping those in need (I've been told some people have been covering the costs of food, offering free food from their restaurants in some cases too) and it's awesome to see British Columbians helping one another at a time like this. (Pembertonians seem cool haha) Unfortunately this is only going to become more frequent and more unpredictable (the weather) and we 100% absolutely need that solidarity to continue on.

As you can tell, there will be all sorts of issues with access, demand and facility space. This facility, while old, is part of the fabric of the community with people of all ages using its services.We have been able to get the following groups identified in the community:* Youth and Adult Swim clubs* Youth and Senior Lacrosse* Youth and Senior Hockey* Seniors/Elderly who live literally next to the community centre* Young Families who are trying to make ends meet who use the services at the centreAll of these groups are being displaced and if you know the north shore, there are very limited community centres and space so having a full service centre go offline for 3+ years is going to impact the community significantly.We have all had a difficult time over the past year and a half and keeping ourselves healthy includes being able to go swimming, skate, dance, and share in community with others. We need to have the flexibility of public services to keep ourselves sane in these crazy times.Voice your opinion of support , please visit here to help keep HJCC open.[Link to Petition](https://change.org/keepharryjeromeopen)Please share with your family and friends and help support this petition! thanks everyone for your support!",5,20,0.83,Discussion,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qswvw9/north_vancouver_harry_jerome_community_centre_to/,2021-11-13 08:27:33,2021,11,13

I ask because distances between cities in North America sometimes surprise people from more crowded continents. Vancouver to Kelowna is close to 400 km and for about 250 of that you are on an empty road with only one town. So don't be shocked by a six hour bus ride.Getting from the airport to the bus station isn't hard in  Vancouver. There is a pretty easy train route and the train stops right at the airport. You will have to look up bus schedules yourself. The bus station is Pacific Central Station.But before leaving the airport ... you might get lucky with a cheap standby flight. Pacific Coastal, Air Canada and WestJet all go from Vancouver to Kelowna.Good luck.Edit: hi again. It seems the ebus service to Kelowna is quite pricey. I just did a quick internet search and Flair has $39 flights. WestJet and Air Canada are both offering $67 flights.

105,no,britishcolumbia,nurvingiel,how do i travel from Vancouver to Kelowna,Came here to say Ebus. Good luck to you! If it makes you feel better Vancouver (and Richmond) are not dangerous cities. It does suck to be alone in an unfamiliar city though.The problem is the airport is fairly isolated so it's a pain in the ass if you have nowhere to stay overnight.The SkyTrain goes to the airport now but it's still a long commute to anything affordable if you do have to stay overnight. I recommend sleeping in the airport in this case as it would be safest. There are come pretty comfortable couches in the airport if you do have to do this.Hopefully you can get a bus soon after your flight arrives to avoid this annoyance. Kelowna is a fantastic city so all your effort will pay off.Edit: it looks like Ebus leaves from the old Greyhound station. Fortunately you can take the SkyTrain from the airport to bus station.Another edit: You want to get off the SkyTrain at Main Street-Science World and then there's about a 5 minute walk to the bus station. It's not quite direct but it's still the best and cheapest way to get there from the airport.,,18,,,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qsmtqc/how_do_i_travel_from_vancouver_to_kelowna/hke9mrh/,2021-11-12 23:46:28,2021,11,12

There's also carpooling apps that you could check out. I've never used them but I heard of one called poparide. There is also a Facebook group for carpooling between Vancouver and Kelowna. Be careful who you go with though. Try and go with your own gender and with people travelling in groups. Also inform us if you do go this route just so other people know where you are.

As it seems now about 1/3 is set to be protected with further negotiations. Interested to hear on this from BC residents. Article in post.,"To answer your questions OP, I would say that yes, this is a hot topic in BC and the average person is aware. However, media releases on the subject don’t even come close to capturing the complexities of this debate nor the general public’s sentiment. I would say that the majority of BC doesn’t care enough to debate, but it is a very divisive topic on the coast where OG logging occurs. The loudest voices come from ENGOs and the logging industry.I’m finding the debate very exhausting because people (on Reddit at least) aren’t well educated on the scope and complexity of reinventing forest land use practices. A lot of issues are coming to a head on this one (indigenous self determination, economics, land use pressure, climate change) so it’s nearly impossible to come into a debate with an absolutist position. I don’t think anyone wants to destroy BC’s biological legacy but there’s certainly no consensus on the best way forward, even among ecologists. The average person has an opinion on old growth deferrals but silent on what to do after deferrals have landed. This is where the rubber truly meets the road. Someone like Andy MacKinnon would advocate for a New Zealand style of conservation whereas Garry Merkel prefers a zoned approach.It’s interesting to hear you say that Sweden deals with similar unrest surrounding clear cutting.

Article in post.,"Most BC residents don't work in the forestry industry, don't talk about it, and don't seem to really care about government announcements. Most only appreciate forests when they go camping in provincial parks. That leaves only a small number of people here that are passionate about our beautiful forests and put their bodies on the line to defend them, and loggers who only see trees and dollar signs, not forest ecosystems or the wildlife within. There's no debate, just war - loggers are desperate for jobs and keeping remaining mills open, and forest defenders are desperate to save the few remaining old-growth stands from the chainsaws. The government hasn't demonstrated any appreciation for the value of unexploited forests, and still refuses to enact endangered species legislation. The [indigenous](https://www.forestrycouncil.ca/) have their own blinkered territorial interests, some are defenders and some are exploiters.[This local organization](https://ancientforestalliance.org/) has good information on old-growth forests in BC and about the ongoing conflicts.The BC government's policy has always been ""talk and log"" - make big announcements, pretend to make positive changes, continue logging and clearcutting while having lots of meetings. If you want to see the last remnants of BC's old-growth forest while they still stand, come sooner rather than later - old-growth forests continue to be clearcut and decimated today, and they'll be long gone before any meaningful regulation gets put in place.About 2.5% of BC's population is Swedish.

112,no,britishcolumbia,slimspida,Driving Vancouver to Alaska in Dec,"To do this as safe as possible, you need to be very prepared. Good winter compounds are a must. VW Golfs handle fine in the snow, but a loaded Golf will not have much ground clearance if there is anything frozen sticking up. Getting hung up can happen. You need warm clothes in case you get stuck. You should tie a key to the outside of the car in case you lock your keys inside.You should only drive during daylight, which is a very small window that far north in winter. That adds several days to a trip or that length.You need emergency supplies including blankets, road flares, traction aids like cat litter, and spare food and water. Spare fuel is a good idea.Breaking down and getting stuck becomes a life or death situation. You should prepare for that.If this trip is recreational in nature, consider flying and renting a car at your destination. The days of accommodation and fuel costs on the trip up aren’t trivial, and the price might be competitive.

112,no,britishcolumbia,Late_Entrepreneur_94,Driving Vancouver to Alaska in Dec,"I'd probably advise against it given your inexperience and vehicle. If you insist on going please take every precaution available. Do your research and prepare for a worst case scenario. A few tips I can think of:1. Get winter tires (it's illegal not to have them) AND chains. A full size spare too (not sure if the Golf has a full size or a donut). Practice putting on chains and changing tires before you go!  It can be tricky if you haven't done it before and you don't want to be learning on the side of an icy highway with trucks driving past.2. Bring food, water, blankets, warm clothes, jackets, gloves, boots, extra fuel, batteries, flashlights, tow strap, candles, road flares, safety cones. Everything you can think of. Its better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Prepare for the worst case scenario.3. Get your car tuned up before you go. Make sure your fluids are good, proper air in the tires, battery is good etc. Bring extra wiper fluid! You will go through a ton of it in slushy/snowy conditions. 4. Plan your route ahead and stick to it! Tell someone your plans (which roads you will take, which hotels you will stay at, when you will stay there etc.) and don't deviate. Call someone everyday and check in with them.5. If something happens to you, stay with your vehicle! Don't try walking back to get help.

112,no,britishcolumbia,Doobage,Driving Vancouver to Alaska in Dec,"To add to /u/Late_Entrepreneur_94 advice:* Reiterate packing stuff to be able to survive in your car.* Also winterize your car. Do you know if your car has block heater? Once you get north enough you will HAVE to plug in or else your engine block will freeze and possibly crack. Motel and Hotels if there is outdoor parking usually have plugs for each spot.* In summer the Highway is known to destroy tires. I have a full spare and two cans of the emergency fill spray.* A bag of sand or road salt wouldn't hurt. * Shovel, even a half shovel or even a collapsible one. * Start looking for winter tires NOW.... there is a supply shortage. * Drive slow and steady don't rush or make sudden changes in snow and icy conditions. * Let people know where you are, where you are going (route details) and an expected arrival time and when you will connect with them again. * Becareful, and most importantly have fun. And non-safety advice? People outside of the Mainland can be much friendlier than here. Don't hesitate in asking questions or saying ""Hi"". Restaurants? When I travel I try to stay away from chain places (unless need a quick coffee and McMuffin) as many smaller places have some great indy places.

112,no,britishcolumbia,Strange_Move_3100,Driving Vancouver to Alaska in Dec,"I work up that way and happen to have a golf. You don’t have to have an SUV or truck fo drive up there, I see people in FWD vehicles all the time and know from experience that golfs are good in the snow. If you can get studded tires I would recommend that over regular winters because up that way the highway gets completely covered with a thick layer of ice. You could get chains if you wanted to but practice putting them on beforehand and make sure they are tightened correctly. If you have a chain fly off while driving with those smaller wheel wells you’re going to have a bad time. Last note about chains is that because a golf is FWD you’ll be putting them on your steer tires which does make handling a bit weird so be prepared to adjust to that. Make sure to pick up thermal under layers, my personal recommendations are: socks — t max, and undershirt and long Johns — Uniqlo (I have both levels as sometime the extra heat is too much). Make sure in general to have extra dry layers on hand so you can quickly add as needed. Once you start getting into areas that are covered with snow and ice try to find a safe place to slam on the brakes and such so that you know how your car is going to respond to the conditions.The truckers that go through there are almost all equipped with in-reach devices which will allow them to contact emergency services if required. They do tend to act as first responders in those areas. They also do know the closest work camps and will reach out on the radio to them to send medical aid. Those areas of the north are, in my opinion, somewhere that everyone is looking out for everyone. Lastly, I would recommend coming back down 37 instead of 97. It’s a beautiful part of the country with a couple cool places to go. When I did my last road trip north I stayed at an Airbnb just south of jade city called vines and puppies glamping wall tent and it was one of the most incredible experiences. Stewart also has a pretty cool feel to it and I would definitely recommend stopping in there if you have the chance. I realize that some of what has been posted in this thread is a bit frightening, and that’s coming from a place trying to help you. Do some research into surviving in cold weather, youtube is sure to have good information on that and be prepared. But you’re not giving yourself a death sentence by wanting to go on this trip. It is most definitely doable, you simply need to be aware of the dangers to prevent falling into them.

I have the semi unique position to have worked at least a week in nearly every bc town over the last 10 years and have always made it my mission to understand what a place has to offer when im working there. so do to that its my duty to offer a detailed response to that list.I will break down each community by four criteria. 1) apparent crime and or social issues 2) work opportunity3) outdoors4) shopping/ restaurants/amenities5) housing opportunity 6) general vibe.1- prince rupert. 1) rupert went through a long time of economic downturn. due to that stagnation the town visually suffers from sagging down town stuck in time. crime isnt extremely apparent but you get the feeling low grade organized crime has involvement in some port activities.2) due to the deep water port employment is on a huge uptick and many high paying low qualification jobs come from ridley island and that is only expanding3) the ocean! if you like boats, hot springs, beachcombing fishing etc this is the place for you. two major issues are there is no public access to the ocean from town and that sucks, also it is so goddamn wet you may have to grow gills.4) mediocre shopping, fantastic restaurants. cow bay is a highlight. the airport is so wierd. you have to take a ferry there. but ferry service is great5) its extremely hard to build on rock and space is limited so get ready to pay a lot of money for a old house slouching towards the sea.6) I hate working in rupert due to the wetness but im not sure there is anywhere id like to be more than out on the water on a sunny day,2- fort st john/dawson creek1- this one wont be super favorable. alot of recreational hard drugs pass through the camps and hotels of the town. you can see if everywhere. has to be the highest pawn shop to population ratio. 2) its major redeeming factor? lots of work to be had but less than a decade ago, low skill work is such a double edged sword. when the work dries up all you have is your health and a unrealistic lifestyle.3) man you better like mud because as soon as you leave town its your top concern. hunting is big in the area but man i dont like it at all.4) they have a movie theater and a ton of chain restaurants. fort has a fantastic sports complex.5) way bloated housing prices are just waiting to pop.6) depressing and gloomy. flat and full of people that dont want to be there. 3- prince george (my town)1) since the wildfires homelessness has been a huge issue with no real resolution. mainly relegated to the downtown core it still is a startling site a few years later. the gang issues that plagued prince decades past are mostly gone and generally it feels far safer.2) prince george has been transitioning away from lumber into the government sector and it has attracted a lot of new people to the town. prince services most of the north in one way or another and has a lot of blue collar and low grade white collar opportunity.3) hidden gem in my opinion. great mountain biking, cross country skiing, hiking, hunting, fishing. skiing withing an hour and the woods are withing 10 mins in any direction,4) most everything you would find in any major city. my bias is showing but i think prince george has the best great restaurant per capita ratio you can find.5) starting to get to typical bc un affordable levels but still obtainable and houses are constantly being built, 6) i feel like pg is in a good place for the most part. lots of young professionals coming to the city to build a life. great outdoor waiting to be experienced and a busy downtown offset a real problem of homelessness. well thats all for now. i have to get to work. if anyone likes this i could do many more towns or offer advise to anyone who may be moving or traveling. i  hate all the mean spirited comments about the north. a lot of people judge a book for its cover. i spent a lot of time recently in southern utah and northern arizona and all over nevada and i can say without a doubt that northern bc destroys nearly every community down there in every way.btw my favorite town in northern bc is smithers followed closely by terrace. happy  early remembrance day!",280,443,0.92,News,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qqxd4g/in_response_to_worst_cities_in_british_columbia/,2021-11-10 15:51:24,2021,11,10

I saw a lot of northern communities really get trashed,  and while some may rightfully deserve the criticism,  I feel as though some of these communities got a bad rap,  while other places get a bit of a free pass.Bad rap:  100 Mile House.  Yeah it’s small,  blip on the highway and can appear a little rough & dumpy.  I’ve spend at least a few weeks in the area every summer over the last 10 years.   It’s seen a lot of improvements in the past while,  there are a few quite decent restaurants, craft brewery,  the downtown runs parallel to the highway (like most small drive-through towns) but it’s not dead by any stretch,  there’s some good local shops and amenities.  I’ve always found the locals to be friendly,  the surrounding area is beautiful and as more & more people move up there it seems to improve every year.  There are challenges, you notice the homeless population has grown,  the housing stock is run down and frequent complaints are that there are few housing options in town.  Lots of housing options outside of town proper though.  If you are an outdoors type person and don’t mind small town living I don’t think 100 Mile house would be a bad choice.   Free pass: this is going to be unpopular but I say Nelson.  I lived there for a number of years in the late 90’s,  and visit friends there at least twice a year.   It’s beautiful,  charming,  the food options are fantastic and the vibe is quintessential small Kootenay ski town.   What drives this place down in my view are all the trust fund hipsters and Big city expats who have come out there and driven the price of everything through the roof.   For a town with low wages and few employment prospects it’s insane.   Also,  I found that the people of Nelson,  especially the hippy/ new age/ hipster demographic are incredibly snobby and cliquey.   You get a lot of spoiled rich Vancouver & Calgary folks who move out there,  look down on the locals and somehow feel that the town is now theirs.  The homeless and drug problems have gotten a lot worse and there’s few supports,  so it’s a bit of a free-for-all in that segment of the population. Lots of conspiracy nuts and anti-vaxxers.   It’s a great ski town and 20+ years ago it had a cool mountain town vibe.  It’s slowly become super expensive, overcrowded and exclusionary.

Sports like soccer, basketball, and volleyball have grown so much in FSJ during the last decade and the city decided to built that piece of garbage.

I do agree with FSJ being depressing and gloomy, especially with how long our winters are. I think that people would only want to stay there if they both like small (but not too small) towns and if they have a lot of friends and family up there.

Unlike urban areas where there is a complex set of rules for everything. 3) airlines.

Its cheap, fast, and the sky train connects from yvr to all the good shopping/events centres. 4) crime. There ain’t any. Or so little it barely matters. People leave their keys in their vehicles so they don’t lose them. True story where I live. 5) Powder King. Most fucking fantastic skiing anywhere. 6) people. Everyone here has a story about how they skidded off the road or had some other kind of issue and six or seven people stopped to haul them back on the road before they even had time to call a tow truck. 7) very high wages.

It's easier to meet people when you already have a friend.- Research the places people have mentioned here. Get a feel for the job market, the cost of rent/houses, etc.- Take a road trip (if you have a car). Go check out the places you're interested in so you can see them first hand. Even line up some job opportunities if you wish.- Look into jobs with utilities (city, Fortis/png, hydro, Telus, shaw, etc.), Government, or other larger union employers that offer a variety of jobs just about everywhere. You can get good pay, good benefits, and a pension. I work for a utility and we can't find people to work.

I am talking about ""this is definitely a green screen"" type photo for a card. However, I have been googling for hours now and all I can find is VERY professional looking photographers who do packages starting at between $250-400+. I have no doubt if we wanted that style of photo, these photographers would be well worth the money!

You can either issue receipts via paper or email as simple as ""Hi, thanks for your e-transfer of $xx.xx for today's 4 hour babysitting session.""FYI, as a student, you can make $13,229 + ~80% of your tuition costs before owing taxes.

158,yes,vancouver,Vespertine724,Advice On Rehoming Our Cat,"Hi Vancouver,Looking for some advice on rehoming our 5-year-old cat. She's very sweet and extremely friendly, but we've come to the very sad point of having to rehome her due to some medical issues in our household. We're pretty devastated to have reached this point, and want to ensure that she ends up in the right home, as she has some specific diet requirements and really needs to be an only-cat in a household. I've had a few shelters recommended, all of which I'm sure are wonderful organizations, but I'm really concerned about leaving her in a ""shelter"" situation, as she doesn't like being around other cats, and I think that would just be way too stressful for her. I feel like in an ideal situation, we could keep her here in our home but work with a shelter/rescue group to help find her a new home and vet the new owners appropriately - is this something that any local groups do?&#x200B;Any other suggestions on how to proceed are welcome! If anyone has any similar experiences in rehoming a pet, I'd love to hear how you went about doing it and ensuring that they went to a good home.

The project has since been [revised](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/broadway-commercial-safeway-redevelopment-1780-east-broadway-2021?fbclid=IwAR0jF2gewn56fuHZz3UO_HiDzU2p7UDU_z1XkYMlm1cDlWWRGdcI7raO1jM) and the number of homes has been reduced for a dozen units in total. The revision means that the project is now going through its virtual open house and is open for additional comments on the City's zoning submission page. I have been tracking the nimbies who are fairly active on Facebook and Nextdoor and they are certainly mobilizing against density and this transit-oriented development. If this concerns you, please make sure that you leave a comment for the City for the rezoning application here: [https://shapeyourcity.ca/1780-e-broadway](https://shapeyourcity.ca/1780-e-broadway)",24,61,0.8,Housing,/r/vancouver/comments/qxrkjn/zoning_yes_mega_towers_at_safeway_20_housing/,2021-11-19 22:47:40,2021,11,19

But not sure if Alberta has much to spare because it used to get some goods from Vancouver.I would say that the situation is much much better than Katrina.  Because the general public is banding together wonderfully to help each other even without govt input.  So many examples.  Volunteer Search and Rescue.  Farmers housing other farmers cattle.  300 volunteers sandbagging 4 critical pumps so the pumps wouldn't be inundated with water and stop working.Private pilots banding together and volunteering to fly people around.  Float plane companies adding new routes for very reasonable ticket costs.Even CN railroad ran special train to get 250 people out of Hope BC which is cut off by road.Now the army is building a new dike to the east of a vancouver.  govt is searching North America for temporary Bailey Bridges.

Most unfurnished places I've seen here have a fridge, stove/oven, vent hood that may or may not be also a microwave, some even a dishwasher.In India the standard voltage is 230 V and the frequency is 50 Hz. You cannot use your electric appliances in India without a voltage converter, because the standard voltage in India (230 V) is higher than in Canada (120 V). I do not recommend using your old electronics/appliances with an adapter for extended amounts of time.   If you can find appliances in India that are made for North American use, I'd recommend razor, hair dryer, coffee maker, blender, toaster, microwave, TV/entertainment system and other home electronics?  If you have to buy new out of your own pocket, \*even if your employer is paying for shipping, check online (Best Buy and Home Depot for example) for prices first, may end up cheaper here.

Check our Ikea site for ideas of sizes. Clothing-wise, best to shop here. Uniqlo, Old Navy/Gap, MEC are all good sources for warm layers, waterproof items.

166,no,vancouver,blurghh,Relocating to Vancouver: Essential stuff to buy before the move?,"Appliances i would leave because the wiring here is different and not all may work with a converter plug.If your company is paying for all your shipping costs (it would be free to you) then yeah it would make sense to send those over as there are huge delays now for a lot of furniture orders. The cost of upholstered and textile containing products (e.g. couches) is especially raised now given the tariff changes. So if you have a great couch or chair, desk, etc and it will cost you nothing to ship, bring those over. Just make sure you take measurements not only of your living space but also the entry and stairs and elevator to make sure it will fit. The last thing you want is to ship a couch you can't get into your place!! But if available, i would agree to ask if you can convert your shipping allowance into a resettlement allowance and just buy here. For clothes, i would honestly just get them here. India's climate is quite different and what works great there for warmer rainy seasons may not be suitable for Vancouver.  Maybe if you have a great rainjacket and boots bring them over to use while you shop for more climate specific stuff here. Other things to consider:- a lot of medical and health items will be way more expensive here than in india. Get extra glasses, contact lenses, teeth mouth guards, etc and bring them with you. same with refills of prescription medications. The exact same generics are sold here for like 30 times the price so even with partial employer coverage it will be more expensive. Do any dental or health work you can in india at a reliable place--dental and optical are pricy here- if you wear business clothes, might be good to get a few tailored pants and a suit or blazer or two. I know in asia I've been able to get very nice clothes tailor made for wayyyyy cheaper than anything here. Maybe bring a couple of size options in case you gain a little weight :) - pick up a few snacks or hard to find spices and bring them over. My old roommate had a really nice tea her fam brought from india and we never found anything in store remotely close to the flavour, although there are lots of import businesses in surrey. I know my persian friends often bring pure saffron back from iran, it is crazy expensive here in Canada. Not sure if india has good saffron or if you use it- high quality textiles for bedding are another thing you could save money on. You can get cheapo bed linens here for lile $60, but the good stuff will be over $150 for a full set.

166,no,vancouver,1u___u1zZz,Relocating to Vancouver: Essential stuff to buy before the move?,"It’s a wet cold here, so even though it only gets to about 0 to single-digit minuses it feels very, very cold (and this is coming from someone who grew up with -20 to -30 degree winters). If you’re used to the heat then you’ll REALLY want to get some good winter/rain gear. I don’t know how common stuff like this is in India since it’s so much warmer, but you’ll be so much more comfortable if you land with these things with you. Otherwise it might be a very uncomfortable first day. So my must-haves for December are:- rain boots, preferably ones with some sort of lining. - a good puffy coat, something that’s waterproof (or at least water repellant). If it’s easier for you to buy a light rain coat in India then that’ll do as well, just make sure you really bundle up with lots of layers underneath- that being said: layers. Lots of layers.- an umbrella (easy to find anywhere, so that’s good!)- waterproof gloves/mittens. Don’t bother with cloth mittens because they’ll just get soak and you’ll be miserable. Leather/pleather works best for me. Again, get lined ones if you can- scarf, winter hat (toque), good socks- if you like going for walks after 4-5pm get something reflective to put on your coat, they have armband/tags/etc that aren’t super ostentatious but still do the job. It gets dark around that time in the winter, and combined with the rain visibility is low so you want to make sure you’re visible to driversAs for appliances, just make sure you have an adapter plug. Maybe a space heater. Other than that just bring the stuff you would normally want at home. The main difference I can think of would be the weather, so if you can find clothes/outerwear for cheaper at home then that’s something I’d focus on. If you need anything else when you get here check out some thrift stores, that’s the best way to get things for cheap out here IMO (just don’t go to Value Village, they’re pretty expensive as far as thrift stores go)As someone else said be sure to factor in shipping costs when you’re deciding what to bring since it might be more expensive if you’re trying to ship something heavy. If you’re arrangement means you can ship whatever you want, I’d also bring a bike.

179,no,vancouver,dangtheman93,Do any of the smaller airports around Vancouver ever offer passenger flights? How come they don't seem as well known?,Boundary bay will never be a major airport for commercial passenger service. It’s much too close to YVR and it doesn’t have a good enough transportation network since all that serves that area are community shuttles. It is on the other hand a large training airport for a couple flight schools and is designated as a port of entry for aircraft coming from the States or anywhere else. Also it wouldn’t make sense for airlines like Air Canada or Westjet to offer service to airports like Pitt Meadows or Boundary bay since it doesn’t make sense business wise since those airports would serve as a terminating destination unlike YVR which you can connect to other destinations without having to leave the airport or transfer. A good example of this trying to happen is Montreal. They stuck with Pierre Elliot Trudeau instead of splitting the domestic and international markets between YUL and Mirabel because it made connections much more complicated and lengthy since passengers had to transfer from one airport to another one,,2,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qx81nk/do_any_of_the_smaller_airports_around_vancouver/hl7weqm/,2021-11-19 05:10:33,2021,11,19

(Not at Fault),"Ignore the downvotes, r/Vancouver is mostly bitter shut-ins who don't approve of having fun in cars.   I went through this with an SL500.  ICBC offered me $5,000 because they couldn't find any comparables in their database (whatever that means) and it was apparently a ""specialist car.""  I disputed the value and sent in multiple listings in BC for similar cars between $12,000 and $20,000.  They raised their offer to $6500.  I hired a lawyer to write a letter as well as a private appraiser to research sale prices of similar cars and give a market analysis.  ICBC came back with a final offer $10,500 which I happily accepted.  So, find a lawyer that specializes in suing ICBC and go from there.  I paid the lawyer $800 and the appraiser $350.  An RSX Type S is a unique car and ICBC is not aware (nor do they care) that the S trim commands a premium.  Don't expect Bring a Trailer values, but don't accept ICBC's offer because it is likely an average of all the RSXs sold regardless of options and trim level.

197,yes,vancouver,AnEroticTale,Question: Why do we hoard so hard at the slightest uncertainty ?,"Vancouverites have absolutely no sense of community, and will hoard stuff for all sorts of reasons. There. I said it. We as a city seem to have this weird tendency of rushing to grocery stores and supermarkets and going absolutely nuts, cleaning stuff off the shelves like there's a freaking apocalypse happening. I understand this behaviour when Covid hit, I mean there was (is) a worldwide pandemic wreaking havoc and taking lives left and right. You couldn't leave the house, so sure, that deserves a pass.But man, time and time again we have seen this repeat itself. Wildfires? People hoarded water bottles. Covid? People hoarded personal protective equipment for resale. Floods? People are back to hoarding toilet paper, eggs and food in general. Heatwave? People hoarded ACs and Fans to sell on craigslist. Double rainbow? Ok, we didn't hoard anything there, good job :). Aurora Borealis? That never came, but I'm sure someone hoarded binoculars.It just strikes me as odd how we have no sense of community. I was just at Costco yesterday, and people were back to buying 3-4 30 roll packs of toilet paper. Why the hell do you need 120 rolls of TP? I have lived in many cities throughout my life, and have seen floods, wildfires, cold snaps and heat waves. Vancouver has seen all of it  in just the last year alone.  Let's not forget Covid. We didn't have it easy, that's for sure. But I have never seen this much desperation, not even in third world countries.But seriously, let's do better. Take what you need, and maybe a bit extra if things are really grim. Share with people around you. Don't panic buy stuff at the slightest uncertainty. And if you do buy way too much, consider donating it to your local food banks or community service programs.

Also, the news is inundated with stories about how multiple structures are collapsing before our eyes - environmental, political, economical - not just because it’s true, but because these are the sort of stories that attract more viewership or clicks. And in spite of this, there are good people and organizations that have volunteered to help those suffering in any way they can.  There is a congregation from a Sikh temple in the Lower Mainland who are both preparing meals for people who have been forced to leave their homes, and finding ways of getting these meals safely transported, including helicopters (I think?).  And I don’t believe for a second that they’re the only one. There are good people out there, including those of you reading this message and feeling frustrated and helpless.  You can turn those feelings into action.  If you have anything extra to donate - non-perishables, an old sweater or blanket, even toys for children, get friends and family to donate even $5 to local, legitimate safety and rescue organizations - find a way to get them where you can do the most good.

Cost of living has also increased and the wages did not keep up - they are slowly normalizing but if you are out of the workforce, you did not get to that stage. Finally, the pension just changed formula and pay out - the amounts given in the past were different. If we want to be positive- maybe they need social time during retirement as travel is hard. Otherwise, the pension is not as good as it once was with our current cost  of living. As an aside, I plan on leaving the lower mainland when I retire so it goes further.

I am hoping to get some feedback on whether I’m one of those people. Background: I live in Vancouver and I have a job (currently remote but will soon move to a 3-day flex schedule) that is a 35 min commute via transit. I don’t need to leave but I’m on a job hunt for better opportunities. There’s a potential gig in North Van that would be a 1 hour commute on transit (TBH even if driving was an option, it may take that long anyway with traffic through DT and over Lion’s Gate). From the 1st interview, the job sounds great so far, but if I end up getting an offer, I’ll need to wrap my mind around spending 2 hours a day on several different buses. TLDR: Is a 1 hour commute via transit crazy long or is it just me? Vancouver folks, please share your perspectives.

The good thing is a lot of people typically commute in the opposite direction you would be going in, so hopefully you wouldn’t run into overly packed busses.I have many friends who commute at least an hour each way to work in downtown Vancouver, but when they add in the walk from home to transit & back again it easily tacks on an extra 20 minutes each day.I have lived downtown for over 15 years to avoid commuting. A lot of people think my rent is obscene but I’m not paying for a vehicle or transit and can walk from work to home in 10 minutes. I think some of this depends on where you are in your life and career.

Spending that much time driving every day takes a serious toll on your mental health, and for me physically it took a toll as well due to some chronic pain. Not to mention the gas bills and the fact that your 8 hour workday is now over 10 hours in reality. While transit might be a bit easier as you don't have to pay attention the whole time, it's still hours of your day wasted. I was eating out more as I just didn't have time in my day to cook, or I wanted to eat before making the trek home. I had less time to do all the household things that need doing and spending time with family and friends. Think hard about what an extra hour or two lost every day really means.If it's at all realistic I'd either move to North Van or find something closer to home.

When I moved to Squamish I needed to leave the house half an hour earlier to get to work on time, but I would also work through lunch partially and leave the office half an hour earlier, so I would still get home at the same time I always did.  I was also in a ride share so I didn't have to drive every single day, and could nap/read/watch a movie etc.For me the potential for a commute to be soul-crushing is the time you lose in your day.  I wasn't too fussed about the time I lost in the morning, because I could catch up on that coffee/sleep/phone browsing during the commute as easily as I could at home.

I did exactly that, a 1 to 1.15 commute for 4 years after I moved to Vancouver (2 years on SkyTrain, 2 by car - both had pros and cons) and you know, it was fine. I moved much closer to work recently as I had a kid which prompted a complete lifestyle change, moving out of the city to somewhere more family friendly etc. But I found an hour totally fine really and always found it funny what a deal breaker that was for so many in Vancouver (where I'm from, an hour would be a luxury). So I'd say go for it if your family situation allows it and the job excites you/furthers your career.

295,no,vancouver,scrumplic,British Columbia floods: Fatalities confirmed near Lillooet as search-and-rescue crews focus on aftermath of mudslides,"(Part 1)A mudslide on a highway in British Columbia has killed multiple people and emergency crews are still searching the debris field south of Lillooet.David MacKenzie, the Pemberton District Search and Rescue manager, said his team found “some fatalities” in a slide on Highway 99, between Pemberton and Lillooet. Witnesses told emergency officials about 10 vehicles were swept off the road, Mr. MacKenzie said. About seven of those have been located.“There were some fatalities that were discovered,” Mr. MacKenzie said in an interview. Pemberton District SAR responded to the emergency around noon Monday, with a team of about 24 people. They searched until dark and returned to the site Tuesday.“We’re hopeful to find people alive. But obviously that diminishes with time, the nature of the slide activity. People being caught up in mud and debris, it certainly diminishes as time goes by,” he said.Mr. MacKenzie would not confirm how many bodies were recovered. Some people caught in the mudslide were able to get out of their vehicles on their ownThe slide is about 42 kilometres south of Lillooet, he said. The highway is also known as Duffey Lake Road.The area near Lillooet is one of two places where search-and-rescue crews were concentrating their efforts on Tuesday after reports from witnesses that mudslides, triggered by a torrent of rain that also caused widespread flooding in the province, pushed cars off highways and down embankments.Canada Task Force 1, an urban search-and-rescue team, finished rescuing people trapped by mudslides on Highway 7 near Agassiz by late Monday. An estimated 140 vehicles containing about 275 people, including 50 children, were stranded.The search-and-rescue task force and Canadian Armed Forces members were expected to enter the slide zone on Tuesday to pull apart debris with heavy equipment and canine units.Emergency officials in Abbotsford, B.C., also announced a new evacuation order Tuesday morning affecting about 1,100 people in a rural area known as Sumas Prairie, just north of the U.S. border. The order applies to a largely rural area dotted by dairy farms and other agricultural operations.Mayor Henry Braun said the Nooksack River on the U.S. side feeds into water systems on the Canadian side. He noted that it’s moving quickly and water levels rose dramatically over the evening. Mr. Braun said the city does not have enough information from the U.S. side to know when the water will level off.He said more than 80 families have checked into the city’s reception centre.“This is an uncertain and scary time for people who are affected. They don’t understand what’s happening and what the future will be,” he said at a news conference Tuesday morning.The City of Chilliwack later ordered issued an evacuation order for an area just east of Sumas Prairie.The heavy rain, floods and mudslides happened in a region that was hit by extreme heat over the summer, which fuelled a destructive wildfire season and led to hundreds of deaths. Experts have said this type of severe weather is becoming more common due to climate change. Wildfires can increase the risk of flooding and mudslides.Across B.C. Tuesday, wind and rain warnings have been dropped as the fierce storm moves on.But Dwight Yochim, senior manager for the B.C. Search and Rescue Association, said 79 groups and 3,000 volunteers have been involved in the search-and-rescue operation for the past 48 hours.He said the teams were focusing on getting everyone who was trapped behind landslides down to safety Monday, and those efforts will be expected to carry on Tuesday. He noted the next step would be recovery efforts, including looking at vehicles that were swept over banks.“There’s going to be a lot of difficult challenges coming up. We’re not even sure who might be missing,” he said. “There have been reports of individuals that haven’t shown up yet, and exactly where they might be is going to be the next challenge as some of those reports are coming in.”He said the rescue effort spans from Vancouver Island to the border of Alberta. He noted one big challenge for the teams is simply access to some of the areas affected by flooding or mudslides.Mr. Yochim said his organization, which does not directly do search and rescue but supports the teams that do, never receives calls from subjects; however, in the past two days he has received about a dozen calls from either people that were trapped or the family and friends of people that were stranded.“It’s unusual that my organization ... gets those calls and they don’t go direct to 9-1-1. So it just shows you the extent of this [event].”B.C. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, in an interview with CBC Tuesday morning, brushed aside suggestions that the province did not adequately prepare motorists, residents and municipalities for the degree of severity of the storm that dumped a month’s worth of winter rains in hours.He said the province has been co-ordinating response with local communities, including in helping set up evacuation centres. More than 20 emergency operations centres have been opened across southern B.C.Mr. Farnworth said the province had given people ample information that a serious weather event was on the way. But those alerts were spread across various advisories, between Drive BC for driving conditions, stream flow advisories to local governments for their communities and general weather warnings.“Those warnings and travel advisories are out. You know there was a lot of a lot of warnings that you know there’s a lot of rain coming and you know what most people stay home. Most people stayed home and the reality is that communities are prepared. The Drive BC site, as I said, is updated on a on a regular basis. People check that they they hear the weather reports. There’s a lot of warning that takes place,” he said.“Everybody was doing the job that they’re supposed to do.”On Monday, the entire city of Merritt, a community of about 7,000 people in B.C.’s Interior located an hour’s drive southwest of Kamloops, was evacuated due to flooding and damage to the local wastewater treatment plant. Emergency officials told residents to head to Kamloops or Kelowna.Southbound lanes of the Coquihalla Highway, a major connection between the Lower Mainland and B.C.’s interior communities, were swept away, limiting evacuation routes and disrupting travel throughout the region for the foreseeable future.Environment Canada said between Saturday morning and Monday night, 24 communities across the province received more than 100 millimetres of rain, with Agassiz, Chilliwack, the Coquihalla summit and Squamish topping 200 millimetres. The most rainfall was recorded in Hope, which had 252 millimetres.Abbotsford fire chief Darren Lee said due to the closure of the highway Monday night, about 5,000 cars were stranded. He said Central Valley Search and Rescue co-ordinated with Abbotsford police and fire team and performed numerous rescues along the freeway.Police chief Mike Serr said the rescue effort has been incredibly challenging, with water rising quickly.“We had cars flipped over, a situation where one member had to throw a life jacket and swim out or wade out toward the car that was overturned to bring someone back. ... That was almost on a regular basis for about two hours,” he said.Mr. Braun said the city’s priority is to ensure people’s safety, but he’s also concerned about the livestock in the poultry industry because Abbotsford is the country’s top egg-producing jurisdiction.He warned that although the weather has dried up, the challenge for his city remains. He asked the public to prepare for not being able to travel for many days.“It’s not over for Abbotsford. That water continues to pour into Sumas Prairie and the waters are rising. That’s not going to disappear in a day or two. So the freeway is going to be cut off for a while.”Motorists stuck bumper-to-bumper on Highway 7 Monday afternoon got a pleasant surprise when workers at Camp Hope on the eastern fringe of the Fraser Valley welcomed them into the religious retreat’s main lodge for a warm meal and roof over their head that night.",,18,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qvimkd/british_columbia_floods_fatalities_confirmed_near/hkwmxoh/,2021-11-16 21:39:17,2021,11,16

We can send stuff through the US, if not by rail then at least by truck. We are only cut off from Canadian roads and rail. Once stuff gets moving through the south it will be fine. So I would expect goods being delivered now will be a few days late while the small stuff gets cleaned up on both sides of the border, and then after that it will just take a bit longer from having a longer route. Once the 99 and 3+1 are clear we can send stuff through Canada again.Also short term there are people stranded in or out of our bubble. But once we get 99 or 3+1 open they will be able to make it through.

310,yes,vancouver,russilwvong,Vancouver city council votes on the Streamlining Rental Plan today,"Update: Postponed to December 14.Background: [""It's easier to elect a pope than to approve a small apartment building in the city of Vancouver.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/qihjbc/its_easier_to_elect_a_pope_than_to_approve_a/) Right now rental housing in Vancouver is scarce and expensive - it's like musical chairs. If passed, the proposed Streamlining Rental Plan will make it easier and faster to build six-storey rental apartment buildings on certain major streets, where four-storey condos are already legal. This would be a significant step in the right direction. We need more rental housing to create more vacancies and bring down rents.After hearing from more than 100 speakers over about 12 hours, council is scheduled to meet at 9:30 this morning to hold a debate (really just reading prepared statements) and vote. [YouTube video stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVjFSDv9PPA).City council is divided, with four consistent Yes votes in favour of more housing (Kennedy Stewart, Christine Boyle, Lisa Dominato, Melissa De Genova), three consistent No votes (Jean Swanson, Adriane Carr, Colleen Hardwick), and four Maybes (Sarah Kirby-Yung, Michael Wiebe, Rebecca Bligh, Pete Fry).I'll update this post once we have the result.Looks like the vote isn't happening until later in the meeting. They're starting with a Metro Vancouver long-range plan update. [Meeting agenda](https://council.vancouver.ca/20211116/regu20211116ag.htm).Update: The decision has been postponed to December 14. The council meeting agenda was too full to get through it today, and the agenda for the next meeting is full as well. I guess this means both supporters and opponents will have a few more weeks to make their arguments to the public.",8,10,0.71,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qvd388/vancouver_city_council_votes_on_the_streamlining/,2021-11-16 17:29:32,2021,11,16

312,yes,vancouver,Rain_Coast,"It would be prudent to re-assess long term plans, in light of the climate situation.","2021 has been a wild year for Vancouver, and for BC: * Heat Dome. * Wildfires. * Bomb Cyclones. * A Tornado. * Atmospheric Rivers. * Unprecedented. Infrastructure. Destruction. Am I missing anything? Feels like it can’t all have happened within six months, doesn’t it? Normalization whiplash is a hell of a thing.To be clear, this past year is not the “new normal” for our weather. Not by a long shot. That’s centuries away.**A primer on what is happening right now:**The events of this year are the +1.1C normal. By the end of the decade we will be finding out what the ~+1.4C normal looks like, and then we'll go on to see what the new ~+1.7C normal looks like in the decade after that. Absent drastic and immediate actions globally, maybe I’ll even live to see what +2.5C degrees looks like. Fun! This increase is very *very* locked in by now, barring actual miracle like cold fusion or covid-23 cutting the global population by 80% or the discovery that magic exists. We have no technology capable of reversing this at any scale. These processes in the climactic energy system are not linear, nor will they occur predictably, so the ride will get increasingly wild. The days of things sloooowly getting weird, just enough to feel the tingle that something was off but never be totally sure, as seen through the 2010's, are over. Once all the arctic ice is gone, later this decade, the albedo losses and heat no longer being reflected or absorbed by melting up there will turn the Arctic into a heat sink for the months of the year it receives 24hr daylight. At that point, the previous energy imbalance and associated circulatory transfer (ie: “climate”) between the equator and poles will be well and truly dead, while the lower atmosphere keeps trapping more and more heat and thus carrying more evaporated moisture. If we then find some kind of tipping point or enter a different cycle in the ocean-atmosphere heat exchange, where currently the oceans are taking up massive amounts of energy – the events of yesterday will look like a footnote. Even in an techno-optimists wildest fantasy, late-gen-x / elder-millenial will never see a stable climate again in their remaining lifetime. Pour one out for Gen-Z.**What does this mean, for you?**Infrastructure in British Columbia is a joke, it is aging and it was largely built or designed in the 1960’s – to engineering standards which never in their wildest dreams envisioned needing to stand up to these kinds of weather events. Billions have been spent on bridges in the Lower Mainland while astonishingly little has been spent on maintenance or upgrades to our lifelines outside of that. In fairness, those lifelines run through terrain so extreme that there is little which could be done in the way of upgrades to truly harden them against events of this nature, and they have been slowly undermined by the effects of resource extraction and climate on their surroundings. It is no great mystery why the worst infrastructure damage in the Fraser Canyon and the Coquihalla, occurred where there were intense wildfires *three months ago*.For every degree of warming we experience, globally, the atmosphere gains the ability to hold 7% more moisture and carry it. Now that the jet stream has fallen apart, this has materialized in the flash-flooding events witnessed in Germany this summer and now the Lower Mainland this weekend. The changes currently ongoing will result in far fewer average-intensity storms spread out through  year, and instead long periods of drought punctuated by storms such as we have never seen before. Didn’t get a lot of rain this summer, did we?These atmospheric river events will get worse, for the remainder of our lives. There is no guarantee another one won’t occur two weeks from now, or in April, nothing is guaranteed anymore, our stable climate is gone. Do you see the picture I’m trying to paint here? Our government has a finite amount of resources to throw at repeatedly rebuilding infrastructure, and as things play out over the next few decades, we are going to witness a dramatic shift in priorities. How many times do you think we will be able to rebuild highway and rail links damaged to this extent? What do you think will happen if an event of this intensity occurs again, as they are in the middle of repairing this damage, and sets the clock right back? It is November, we have a long season of precipitation ahead of us.Engineering is not magic, there are limitations to what we can achieve, the terrain our road and rail links traverses is severe and cannot ever be fully mitigated. If you haven’t traveled the Thompson & Fraser and seen how tenuously those rails hold on, well, take a trip to google maps. They’re built *on moving ground*. If there was a ""better route"", they'd have built it there in the first place.How long do you think the Lower Mainland can sustain having its primary transportation links severed, before it begins to see a reduction in perceived importance and critical infrastructure investment is shifted up to alternative ports and destinations? Annually? Semi-annually? Quarterly? How long have we been trying to mitigate the landslip at Big Bar now? Going on half a decade? Do you think we have that much time to burn, keeping hundreds of kilometers of road and rail open every time they're taken out?Friends, I don’t particularly care if you view this all as hyperbolic nonsense. You are currently cut off from the rest of the country, likely to be that way for weeks, and if that doesn’t open your mind to how rapidly things are changing (*after the rest of this years events*) there is little I can do to help you. There is endless, extremely alarming and well established, science on the cascading failures currently occurring in our climate. It’s no longer a debatable topic. It would be prudent to take a good hard look at how long you want to build your life in the lower mainland, or wherever you may be. To evaluate the resiliency of your home in the face of volatile, unpredictable, and increasingly severe climate events. This isn’t going away, it’s going to get worse, and there is no guarantee any infrastructure will remain recognizably functional two decades from now. The center of economic power and importance in this province is increasingly unlikely to be Vancouver, by the 2050's, there are too many environmental factors we don't control working against it as these cycles of destruction continue to ramp up.It would be wise to keep an open mind, and consider options.

The fact that many people in the interior have to access healthcare in the LM. Or drive to Vancouver to fly internationally.

318,yes,vancouver,marshmallowpouf,Pedestrian Accident on 41st Ave and West Blvd,"TLDR, i got hit by a car and I’m posting here because I’m not really sure what to do. I recently moved to Vancouver from Toronto in September this year to attend UBC. I don’t have family/friends here besides my boyfriend. I was walking home with my boyfriend on Sunday night around 8:30pm when I was hit by a car at the crosswalk. The walk sign was on and I saw the car stop but then it accelerated and hit me on my right side. My boyfriend who was walking to the left of me did not get hit. I felt the tire over half of my right foot and I think the car’s bumper hit my right thigh. I fell to the ground (not sure if it’s from the impact or the pain). I was crying because I was in shock and in pain. I was terrified because at that moment I didn’t know if I could ever walk again.The driver came out of the car and she kept saying she was sorry. I don’t fully remember the rest of the details besides the ambulance sirens and getting transported to the hospital. Luckily my X-rays came out great (no broken bones our fractures surprisingly). My right leg feels extremely sore and my right foot (especially the sole and heel area) is painful whenever any pressure is applied to it. I would consider myself to be very lucky that I got out of that accident with minor injuries. I’m a bit terrified of the intersection where the accident happened. I have to cross that same crosswalk every time I go to school/come home from school. Anyways, it’s been a day and I’m still in shock and in pain. I’m not sure how to heal from the pain and trauma. I don’t really know what to do besides take Advil every few hours. I’m also finding it hard to fall asleep. I would appreciate any tips on how to deal with this.

Because you only had soft tissue damage it's not likely you're going to make a bunch of money off this, but ICBC will cover your expenses for physiotherapy etc going forward.Secondly, keep accurate medical records of everything that you need because of this accident. They will become invaluable when calculating your compensation.Otherwise, find a physiotherapist who you are comfortable with. I got recommended the physio shoppe on commercial Dr in Vancouver and the owner, Trevor, was fantastic at his job and helped enormously through the process. Your mileage may vary though, so get other recommendations based on your location and preferences.Focus on the recovery from this first and the compensation second.

A virtual open house is live at: [shapeyourcity.ca/broadway-plan](https://shapeyourcity.ca/broadway-plan). Open house materials explain how different areas in the Broadway Plan might evolve in the future, and show 3-D elements of the plan including the kinds of new buildings that neighbourhoods could see. Also available for review are: a high-level strategy for the design of public places and spaces; figures on how much housing and job space could be built; and details on some area-wide policies including housing, jobs and economy, transportation, public benefits and community well-being. The online survey for feedback is open until **November 30, 2021.** Join us for the Broadway Plan AMA and bring your questions.

365,yes,vancouver,VoteForMartinKendell,The lesson from this past weekend: BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST!,"I just worked a 12 hour shift at the City of Vancouver and we got absolutely obliterated on the weekend with the amount of rain and flooding that occurred.I can't state this enough...for the sake of you and your family, you need to have an emergency preparedness kit ready to go in your home (and also in your vehicle). Do not depend on your municipal, provincial or federal government to bail you out in the event of a catastrophic event. If we ever encounter a huge earthquake in this region, the first 72 hours is going to be crucial and emergency crews are going to be stretched to the limit with their response. If you don't have the necessary emergency supplies, there's a good chance you're going to be SOL.Also, make sure to get insurance to cover your property and belongings. I had to deal with a lot of homeowners with flooding basements who were freaking out and wondering who was going to be paying the bill for damages.Stay safe out there!UPDATE: For those of you asking about what to put in an emergency preparedness kit, this is a good start: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-management/preparedbc/build-an-emergency-kit-and-grab-and-go-bag",172,716,0.96,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qun0ji/the_lesson_from_this_past_weekend_be_prepared_for/,2021-11-15 18:31:32,2021,11,15

Do this every year after your AGM because policies change--especially in the last two years. Does your strata policy cover alternative living arrangements if you're displaced for months or years?

I've Ben out here a year and I know I'll have to throw in the towel in a couple of months. I make okay money but I'm not able to save at thr rate I need to. I'm worried about retiring. I'm at least 25 years from retirement but I'm so scared out here.I'm looking at having to spend 50% of my income on just rent to live alone (I tried to do the roommate thing and that will go up to $1100 per month to live closer to work 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️)For the first time I cried this morning.

Canada is more generous than I realized until my dad retired and complained about his OAS clawback (because he was still working ).  If you had no taxable income after retirement (ie : RRSPs or other job ) CPP - Max is 1200/mo.  Most don't receive that but if you have lived in Canada your whole life, you will be close. I see mine currently says just under $1000.  If you had no taxable income after retirement other than CPP,  as a single person:  (ie : no RRSPs or other job)  OAS + GIS would be about $850. -Ok, so of course this is not a huge amount of money, but it's not nothing either.  It made me feel a lot better about how I didn't need a million dollars at retirement to survive.   I  have a pact with few friends that if we're all alone when we're old and poor we'll rent a place together    like the Golden Girls.  :-) I expect to have some kind of part time job as I age but I don't have a problem with that.

Almost bought an older 2 bedroom 1000 sq ft unit with large patio for 200k at same time I was looking for mine. That place has likely more than doubled in price in last 6 years but that's still a decent deal for a spacious two bedroom unit.

That’s a privilege not everyone has and if we didn’t have that option we probably would have not pursued having kids, or rented forever, or left the province.

Look at personalfinancecanada, or Ontario,  or heck subreddits in Australia or the U.S.Everyone is really hung up with play the rat race these days.  Live your life, make sure you are happy.   There is research that shows that home ownership actually makes you less happy than renting all other things being equal.    This is mostly because instead of spending money and time on experiences, you are spending it on maintenance.Double income is a game changer.    Don't rush out to find love,  but maybe make it a priority.  (Also, bonus, it should make you happier sharing life with someone)Pension:   Do you have a pension?  This is a big one.   A pension + either some savings or house ownership is very much enough to retire on.  My parents are these people, and now have more money than they thought they would because they didn't account for the savings of not working (one less car,  less eating out,  clothes, parking, union fees etc) .Home ownership:  If you really need to own before retirement,   25 years is a long time.  In the next year to two years, rates are increasing.  This should either cool the housing market, or cause a reversal.  There are also alternatives like leasehold.   You can buy a leasehold condo for very little, and live in it until you die.  It'll depreciate, but since people use it like less of an investment it's not a bad option to live in.Depending on Income, look  up some ""lower income /under market rentals"" .   People always guffaw at this,  but there are many that you can qualify for if your income is sub $110,000.   Yes,  if you make $70,000 you can qualify for a type of social housing essentially.Also,  it never hurts to look at other employment opportunities.   I doubled my income in the last 5 years by applying for jobs internally,  letting HR know I wanted more responsibilities and compensation.

371,no,vancouver,Eswyft,How do you all do it?,"Can't really offer any opinions without income. This is hard advice, but the answer is often earn more. This means aggressively pursuing new jobs constantly and moving up the pay ladder.This is obviously easier said than done.I was living in a studio (downtown) making 70k a year alone up until 2 years ago. I saved enough to buy a 1 br out in the suburbs. I was able to leverage up and earn about 25k more by moving around the industry i work in, which is currently construction pm work. My partner said she wanted to buy together, so we bought a 1 br in vancouver, fairview, last year.At about 175 combined we are fairly stress free money wise. We just did 2 weeks in paris, and usually do 2 trips like that a year. While at home I spend money going out with friends and drinking/eating and that's about it. My other hobbies are video games, I usually spend about 3k a year on hardware and games, and outdoors stuff which is mostly free. We should be able to retire fairly comfortably at 60. I did not start saving for retirement until well into my 30s. Even if you start at 40 and start putting away a decent amount, it's no problem. Later it's still doable! Just have to save harder.We do not pay for any car in any way. Work pays for my vehicle. This is a necessity for me or I don't take the job. We RARELY drive though, if I didn't need it for work I would not have a car. I can count the times I've used it in the last year outside of work on two hands.My biggest advice is do not be afraid to change jobs often. Either for happiness or money. I'm 41, I've been a mcdonald's manager, an air traffic controller (ifr), a network ops consultant (school to match, CIS) a surveyor, a home depot worker, construction foreman, and pm. That isn't even a full list. The highest paying was the ATC but you don't get to choose where you live and I hated that. I'll out earn it by the time I'm done I think anyways. I quit what I was doing and went back to school at UBC in my late 20s.Life is both longer and shorter than you think. You have time to do amazing stuff, and lots of different things.

They've artificially constrained housing supply for decades, and this is the result - they've completely fucked over people like you.  It's their fault not yours.My partner and I are both engineers with ~10 years of experience, and I have a master's degree.  We are smart and hard workers, so even compared to other people at our experience levels, I think we're probably top 10% value for employers.We also have a small side business that we run together.  All of this means that we're super lucky - our combined household income is four or five times the median for our neighborhood.No kids, no pets, one old car, we rent a small laneway house for $2,000 per month.Even given the above, we can barely afford to live here, and will never even consider buying a house.  It only works because we lived and worked in the southeast US for a few years after graduating.  When we lived there we made a bit more money and spent WAY less what we do here, so we were able to save A LOT.  Without that foundation, we simply couldn't live here and still meet all of our financial goals.The only reason we live in Vancouver is because we hate cars.  (Shout out to [The War on Cars](https://thewaroncars.org/)!)  Like, the mountains are nice and whatever, but the reason we're here is the pedestrian / cycling experience.  If you're living in Canada, there is no where else that is close to as safe and pleasant (and, it's far from perfect here.)Everyone saying ""move farther out"" is being silly, that destroys the whole point of living here.  If you're gonna live the massive-commute car life anyway, move to Calgary.  It's easier to drive, way more affordable, still has mountains, get's a bit colder but is much sunnier.Anyway, good luck figuring out your next move.

Kind of sucks taking a 20% pay cut to move to a small town, but if you can find equivalently cheaper housing, maybe have to do it. I know a moderate number of 'middle aged' millennials who've bit that bullet.3. Borderline dramatic action involving protest which gets on the news and gets actual policy change. A few dozen people have managed to make cutting down a relatively few trees in the middle of nowhere a major policy issue which is getting acted on - yet the cost of housing is seriously and negatively affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the GVRD and yet the most we seem to do is groan about it on reddit.1 and 2 are essentially rolling over and taking it. 3 is something that ""we"" have not really mobilized on - There have been a lot of mass social movements in the last 24 months around various social issues, but this hasn't been one of them.

The unit is a 1 bedroom/bath and is something like 575-600 square feet. I looked for a LONG time, like 2-3 months, to find the right place. I also got quite lucky in that the suit I found was originally the demo unit or something, for the 1 bedrooms, when the building first went up so the drywall and baseboards and stuff was kind of beat up, but I think that also kept the price down.

I am 27, originally from Haiti I'm the Caribbean and had to work my way up and to the job I'm at now. I'm also a mom to a 17 month old. We live a 30 minute bus ride (if there's no accident), to King georgd station and live in a 2 bedroom for 1400+ utilities. I work a very high paying job, and am lucky enough to bring my daughter with me but commuting almost 2 hours from Surrey to Vancouver for the last year has caused me to fall into depression. Especially trying to keep a toddler entertained that long without shoving a phone in her face, but time to time I have caved. Our landlord is raising our rent another 100$, and we pay utilities and can't use the laundry in our inner suite, internet hardly works, and the noise is unbeatable,  so thay has contributed to feeling low. But I have found, there is always a bright side if you work toward a goal. Took awhile, but we met this amazing mom the same age as me, with two daughters with her partner and I am moving into their 5 bedroom house, deck, backyard with trampoline, swing, slide and it in 15 minute walk from Kitislano Beach. Ill only be paying 950/$ for a huge room with my own patio, and my daughter will be in her own room as well. I will be saving over 900$ a month as like you said, most, if not all of my income goes straight to rent, groceries, transiting to Vancouver has become very expensive as we're depe into Surrey. My daughter also just got into a really nice daycare a block away, and it's going to really help not having to spend my whole day commuting and stuck in traffic and being walking distance. It's really sad what vancouver has become. Before I moved abroad in 2018, I was paying 950/$ in East Vancouver to live in a one bedroom suite. Now places in Surrey are starting 1500/$, and if you want to live near the skytrsin it's more. We went between thinking of moving to Calgary, Victoria or Quebec-- but we have such deep roots here, my daughter can now live with two friends as well as being able to live with my best friend in a very beautiful home. I hope you find your goal, and hitting this point - I've been there. It can only go up from here. My advice though, it may not be an option with the pandemic is travel. I have hit my worst in Vancouver and saved up 8k and moved to Europe. I lived in Barcelona, South of France, Ireland, London UK and Toronto. I loved each place but always ended up coming back here. I admit, we have the nicest mountains, fresh water, fresh air and something about leaving really makes you appreciate here. Since having my daughter, I feel like a tourist in my own city.

I only started putting money away for my future less than 10 years ago and I am about 20 years away from retirement, but by the time I get to that age, retirement might be 70 or 75, who the fuck knows. I don't have any inheritance coming, nor does my partner, though her mum and step-dad do own a home in the interior, so we may have some future there, but at this point we have no idea.Essentially, we are coasting right now, saving as much as we can while still indulging in leisure and entertainment products. We've definitely seen a difference in how we shop, more often going for bulk items, reducing the amount of meat we eat and buying it less often. I know it's tough out there though. I have a friend on disability who is playing a little musical chairs with their housing because anything affordable on disability is low income housing that's either slumlord style or supportive for mental health and addictions.

371,no,vancouver,Grounded_mama,How do you all do it?,"I am married with two children but we've lived off of one income for the last 17 years. We've lived below our means, sacrificed and done without. Very few holidays, mostly camping, and lots of outdoor activities that are free or fairly inexpensive. We rarely eat out and I make most of our food from scratch. We only have one car and it is the first new car that we've owned and we saved and paid cash for it. We bought a townhouse about 14 years ago, lost money on that when we sold but managed to buy a duplex and then finally a house in a great family neighborhood. Our income is now between $150-180k but we still live frugally. Honestly, even with this income it's tough. Good luck and try not to let it get you down. It's tough out there but as long as you're willing to work hard and make sacrifices, you'll find a way.

I understand how long it can take from first-hand experience saving my money slowly the last 6 years or so.You said you tried to do the roommate thing and it didn't work. This is a sacrifice that you have to make if you want to save money.

I have friends that have 6 people living in a five-bedroom house, cooking food every day, and taking transit so their total expenses are only $600 per month and the rest of their income goes to increasing their wealth. Personally, I don't save a crazy amount, but I make small sacrifices and slowly grow my wealth to be able to afford a property of my own.

This way we could rent top and bottom out which brings in double the monthly mortgage ,  so adds approx $2000/month to our income after mortgage .  $30,000 took a while to scrimp up for down payment , but instead of paying 600k for condo here and trying to pay the $2000/month ourselves, the rental house in the interior has allowed us 3 years later to buy a condo down here and it pays the mortgage for us.

This isn't ignoring that many things are trending in the wrong direction, but the key to this is our current societies expectations are totally out of whack. At no other time in history have people felt like they ""deserved"" more, and expected more. Everyone wants everything, and they want it now. Choose your sacrifices or they'll choose you.Seriously, think about that. You are always making a sacrifice whether you realize it or not. People in these subs are also continually complaining, but when given valid options, refuse to make the sacrifice. Trust, it's not worth it to feel validated on Reddit because everyone complains the system is broken. If you're doing that then it's ear that you didn't choose to sacrifice, it chose you.You want to retire early? Stop spending over half your salary on rent in one of the most expensive cities in the world. You want to buy a house and not be house poor?  Buy in a cheaper community. You want to reach the pinnacle of your career? Don't expect to spend as much time with friends or family. These are all examples of choosing something and knowing the sacrifice.

Your money can go further in almost every other city in NA, but that's the choice you make by living there. If you pretend you aren't making that sacrifice, then you're just being naive, and is the situation many people express in these subs. The sacrifice has chosen you.

I’m in a tiny basement suite in North Van paying $1500 a month in rent, which includes everything thankfully. I love living here, close to mountains, biking and skiing but it’s not sustainable long term on my own. I could afford a mortgage with a SO but can’t afford to buy on my own (or possibly ever these days!). No family money here! If you’re sticking around a while yet, my advice is to find the best, cheapest accommodation (with roommates if you can) to keep your costs down. Yes it’s hard, takes time, and a fair bit of luck but it’s worth it. That said, a lot of folks are in a similar place… just waiting for one last straw to break before they’re gone for good. For now, if you can try and enjoy living here. Maybe it’s not forever.

373,yes,vancouver,pyro-genesis,Update: Parking in Mob Territory - The Farce Awakens,"[This is where we left off:]( https://old.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/ql5qj3/accidentally_parked_in_a_mobrun_lot/)On a dark and rainy evening I parked in the empty City of Vancouver parking lot out front of the Vancouver Academy of Music instead of the free lot that was around the back; oops! I received a ticket from EasyPark for $70 that would slowly increase to $140 over the course of 21 days (for those who like math that's an APR of over 1700%).To file an appeal I was directed to EasyPark's site (EasyPark being owned and operated solely by the City of Vancouver), where they asked for my infraction number, email address, phone number, and a brief statement as to why I don't owe them $70 - $140. As a favor, they state they'll not start increasing my fine until they have responded with a decision. What the heck, might as well give it a go right? I filed an appeal and waited to hear back, fully prepared to hear ""No, screw you, pay us"" and just pay the $70.Well, I hadn't heard anything, no emails, no phone calls, no text messages. Radio silence. This was odd, and somewhat concerning because of the arbitrary way they just keep automatically demanding more money as time goes by. I did a little digging, and oh boy they got me good! Turns out when I gave them my contact details in the form of my email address and phone number, they weren't actually intending to contact me using them at all! Instead they took that information and turned the temporary login I was forced to create into an EasyPark account. I had to log in to that account and find the link where they replied to my appeal. Predictably they said ""No, screw you, pay us."" But that was days and days ago, so the clock had started ticking on the fine again. Now I owe them $90.This is approaching ""[...] on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'.” levels, but it's the City of Vancouver's official way of handling parking tickets. Haha, they got me good! Looks like the brandy and cigars for the next Council meeting are on me, you rascally boomers you. This was absolutely not a bad-faith show of communicating in order to trigger an escalating fine, and is definitely a legitimate tactic to keep the Council wet-bar stocked over the holiday season.But wait! I hear you say, what if I have a ticket, or a fine? How could I possibly know if I've forgotten my login and never received any communication? I too must be sure that I'm doing my part to keep the City Council well supplied with liquor and cigars! Good news! EasyPark and the City of Vancouver have a number you can send a text message enquiry to, and they reply immediately with a message saying an agent will be in contact within 24 hours. Much better than waiting for days and days, or risking a leopard attack trying to find the letter they may or may not have sent. Here it is, available on their site: [1-888-501-1343](https://www.easypark.ca/about-easypark/contact-us). Be sure to include your license plate number and/or violation number. Your violation number looks like this: EP3222801234. That's not your one, obviously. That's just an example of what it looks like. Yours will be similar, but not identical.Please do your civic duty and check to make sure you don't have any unpaid parking violations, and make this holiday season for the City Council a great one.Edit: The lesson here, clearly, for me (and everyone) to pay more attention to where you're parking. I fully acknowledge that I parked incorrectly, and using the appeals process that was offered I simply explained that it was an accident. Now the appeal has denied I have paid the fine. However, the very nature of the process, the unreasonably rapid escalation of the fine, and the bad-faith efforts to communicate after asking for contact details is not something we should be accepting from a Council owned and operated business.",15,0,0.3,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qujmi5/update_parking_in_mob_territory_the_farce_awakens/,2021-11-15 16:00:26,2021,11,15

The basic corporate structure is a lot of middle management with a 1-2 of head store managers at the top, the middle management has weekly meetings where they share all kind of details (and biases) with each other - you may notice that managers that liked you beforehand will start to treat you differently as other managers biases or misconceptions are spread in these meetings.4. You can get some slick gear for the cheap, but it may not be worth it for the headaches that MEC members will give you... your training also may not cover all the inevitable questions you will get. 5.

Big mistake.  I used to trust their gear,  but it got shittier and shittier for more money and no warranty.  Arteryx is kind of run on the same model.

I'd like to ask you all what are your recommendations for some everyday pants that can withstand the wet weather. I've looking for something that can be worn everyday around the city with an understated style, not something that looks like I'm going to do the Grouse grind (ie. Arcteryx Zeta SL pants). I currently have a pair of Veilance Align MX that kind of does the job, I know it's not full weather-proof but the material is heavy duty enough to withstand rain and it has taped-seams that help. My problem with that pair (and with the Veilance line in general) is that the rise is incredibly low, I prefer pants that ride a little bit higher on the waist rather than the hip. I'm willing to spend some money on this (up to $500) on this, but haven't really found anything that is similar to the Veilance pieces.

You can get muscles more sore on one side because of imbalances like habitually leaning over to one side of your chair or having to use your mouse arm more. We all get it to some degree, but others more sever than others. Basically, your head is as heavy as a bowling ball, and being hunched over all the time makes your neck and back work harder to keep it up.Everything you've mentioned helps, but they are all passive means of alleviating the symptoms.  There's nothing wrong with that, it's what you need at the time. For long term relief you kind of have to approach it like an athlete in training and look at making structural change in your physique. First, take an audit of your work. If the monitor is too low, the keyboard is too high etc, then you'll keep coming back to the same stressors every day if you don't change that.For me what helped was weights and being my own physio-rehab program. I always concentrated on ""pull"" and back muscles as much as I could so that the ratio of front to back strength was always in check. For example, if I was benching 185lb, then I would at least target 150lbs on rows, or try to put it as much time on the pull-ups, dips and face-pulls as possible.  The key word is ""balance"", if your shoulders and head are constantly pulled forward, then your muscles are out of balance and you have to work on strengthening the weak parts. It is not enough to just stretch out the tight muscles. Basically, it's the muscles that you don't see in the mirror that need to concentrate on. You also don't need to go to a gym, there are some [body-weight exercises](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/g30917648/bodyweight-back-exercises/) you can do.But whatever you do, you really have to approach it like a body builder with the mindset of building your muscles.*tldr; big wall of text basically affirming that yes, exercise is the key*",,16,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qu9hv8/any_fellow_vancouverites_cured_themselves_of/hkoxl74/,2021-11-15 06:43:50,2021,11,15

Do you need a better pillow and mattress? What are you doing outside of work hours and are there any activities of daily living that are exacerbating the problem? A physio or chiro or RMT appointment might be an hour or up to a few hours a week. That’s great but not enough. As someone who has had to rehab some chronic issues, what you do in all the hours outside of those services is more important than any modalities offered by those practitioners.

389,no,vancouver,corriecorgi,Vancouver ladies: what jacket / coat do you wear for most of the year?,"I used to work at MEC and that jacket is great. I have the snowboarding version and my friend has the same model you linked to.I find it too hot to wear unless it's ""deep"" winter, but I like to wear lots of hoodies and sweaters. If you prefer to wear just a t-shirt underneath, then it's great. A lot of people also like that it's long to keep you warmer and it looks a bit dressier.A few things to consider:\- will you be walking anywhere? This jacket isn't super breathable. I would recommend a rain shell (MEC Hydrofoil is great if you want to stick with MEC brand) and then a puffy jacket underneath (MEC Aura hoodie is good, or a down one). A lot of rain shells have ""pit zips"" too where you can air out underneath. \- how long will you be in the rain for? If you're on the MEC site, click on the ""compare"" button and it will let you compare different models for how long they will waterproof for. Generally the higher the number, the better. For example, the Confidante is 12,000 whereas the Hydrofoil is 20,000Goretex is popular because it's very, very waterproof and very breathable. It's expensive but a good jacket will last you many years. I ended up investing in Arcteryx like a basic bitch, but I literally wear it all year round. The three in one jackets are nice for around here. The North Face has a few good ones. I preferred getting my mid layers and rain shell separately though because I was able to get some of them on sale/use ones I already had. Regardless of what jacket you go with, be sure to pick up some Nikwax or a similar technical fabric wash. NEVER use regular detergent on it. It makes the fabric ""sticky"" and the rain won't slide off of it anymore.",,15,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qu6yns/vancouver_ladies_what_jacket_coat_do_you_wear_for/hkowmhi/,2021-11-15 06:32:38,2021,11,15

401,no,vancouver,russilwvong,Do you you think the Federal / provincial municipal governments will actually do anything to make housing in metro Vancouver BC more affordable for renters and first time home buyers and if so what do you think they can do?,"> Do you you think the Federal / provincial municipal governments will actually do anything to make housing in metro Vancouver BC more affordable for renters and first time home buyers and if so what do you think they can do?I hope so.Why is housing so expensive in Metro Vancouver? Part of it is speculation (home prices are high compared to rents); part of it is that rents are high.Why are rents high? It's a mismatch between jobs and housing: there's lots of job openings, we're adding more every day, and there's not enough housing, especially rental housing.Why isn't there enough housing? Because land use regulations are extremely restrictive (apartment buildings are illegal in most areas), requiring a rezoning (i.e. a change to the law) for almost any significant project. This takes 12-18 months - it's a slow process.Why is rezoning so slow? Because there's always a lot of opposition from neighbours, which is amplified by the public hearing process (speakers are self-selected), and municipal politicians listen to their voters.Why is there so much local opposition to building more housing? Small-c conservatism - people like their neighbourhood the way it is, that's why they live there. They worry about local services (schools, daycares, public transit, parking) being overloaded. From this perspective, high housing costs may actually be a good thing, since they keep more people out.So how do we fix this and build more housing?One way is to bypass restrictive land-use regulations entirely. That's what the Squamish Nation is doing with the [Senakw project](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/03/25/how-a-canadian-indigenous-group-could-outwit-nimbys): they're building 59-storey towers at the foot of Burrard Bridge, a total of 6,000 homes, mostly rental. They can do this because the city doesn't have jurisdiction over their land.> In 2019 the city vowed to put up 20,000 new rental units. Senakw would meet roughly a quarter of that target, points out [Ginger] Gosnell-Myers. “The Squamish Nation is more responsive to average Vancouverites than Vancouver city hall.”If BC Housing and CMHC had the capacity to build housing themselves, they could do something similar. (Provincial and federal projects aren't actually subject to local-government jurisdiction - they only follow local laws and regulations out of courtesy.)Another way is for local governments to figure out how to make the approval process faster. (In the city of Vancouver it seems like a majority on council always vote to approve the rezoning, it just takes a really long time.) On Tuesday (Nov 16) there's going to be a vote on whether to make it legal to build six-storey rental buildings on certain major streets without requiring a rezoning (the ""Streamlining Rental Plan""). I put together some information at [morehousing.ca](https://morehousing.ca).If local governments can't figure it out, I expect the province will need to step in. Local governments are creations of the province, so the province has the power to do so. [Frances Bula](https://www.sightline.org/2021/05/10/push-me-pull-you-local-and-provincial-tensions-in-bc-housing-policy/).I thought the recent [MacPhail Report](https://morehousing.ca/macphail-report) was a pretty good blueprint describing what needs to happen. (1) Streamline local-government processes for approving rental housing projects. (2) Reform development charges - right now local governments negotiate to take about 70-80% of the increase in land value whenever there's a rezoning. (3) Provide a lot more federal funding to non-profits to buy and preserve older, cheaper rentals.Another idea is to build a lot more student residences, maybe with one-third federal and one-third provincial funding. This could happen pretty rapidly, and it'd reduce the number of students renting existing places.If we can't figure it out, then I expect we'll see something like the situation in the US, where the fastest-growing states are in the Sunbelt (even though wages are lower) because housing costs are low, while California's population is stagnating (even though wages are high) because housing costs are so high. In other words, BC's population will stagnate or shrink, as more people move to Alberta. Calgary and Edmonton have plenty of land and it's easy to build, so supply responsiveness is high and housing prices aren't going to go through the roof, no matter how many people move there.Besides bringing down the high cost of renting, what about the insane cost of owning?In some ways the two issues are linked. If renting becomes cheaper, that'll put downward pressure on home prices. Some people will rent instead of owning. First-time homebuyers will find it easier to save for a downpayment. Investors who bought property at inflated prices and are renting it at a loss (figuring they'll make money when they sell) will find it increasingly painful to hold on as the loss increases.There's been a lot of measures brought in over the last few years to increase scrutiny and taxation of foreign investment in real estate, which has had a noticeable effect on the price of more expensive properties: foreign buyer surtax, empty homes tax, speculation and vacancy tax, school tax, Land Ownership Transparency Registry. I expect this will continue to tighten over time, since foreign investors don't have a vote. The federal government is planning to bring in a temporary ban on foreign investment in real estate.Another way to bring prices down would be to tighten borrowing, a key factor in any speculative bubble: increase the mortgage stress test, tighten regulation of alternative lenders, crack down on mortgage fraud.Kennedy Stewart's proposing a way to redevelop a single 50-foot lot into six individually owned homes (or a 33-foot lot into four homes). On a larger scale, we're in a townhouse near Main and King Edward: back in the 1980s the builder took a handful of detached houses, tore them down, and put up a 32-unit townhouse complex. Doing more of that ""missing middle""-type project, making ownership more affordable without requiring people to buy an entire 33x122 lot, seems like a good idea.Tokyo has a lot more people than Vancouver, but you can buy a new detached house there for US$300,000. According to [Life Where I'm From](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbC5j4pG9w&t=330s), the cost of land per square foot is about the same in Edogawa as in Burnaby; the difference is that the minimum lot size in Burnaby is much larger. ([A commenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbC5j4pG9w&lc=UgyKNQeNCOI65CvgkQh4AaABAg) points out that prices are lower in Edogawa because the flood risk is high; elsewhere in Tokyo the price of a new small detached house, 750 square feet, is more like US$500,000.)",,10,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qtx4pb/do_you_you_think_the_federal_provincial_municipal/hknbsxr/,2021-11-14 22:43:20,2021,11,14

401,no,vancouver,ProbablyInnuendo,Do you you think the Federal / provincial municipal governments will actually do anything to make housing in metro Vancouver BC more affordable for renters and first time home buyers and if so what do you think they can do?,"This is a problem that has been 20-30 years in the making, and it will take about that long to normalize if we take aggressive action now. I think govts have taken some good actions in recent years (spec tax; additional school tax; foreign buyers tax), but is dancing around the edges of the problem. The core problem is pretty straightforward: way more people want to live here than we have places for people to live. To fix that, we need enable way more housing to be built (which takes time) and disincentivize the use of property as an investment vehicle.Some of the main things that can be done, and the levels of government that can move on it are:1. abolish single-family zoning in high population areas (basically all of Vancouver) enabling a minimum of 4-6 storeys, as Oregon, New Zealand, California have done (primarily a municipal responsibility - provincial supremacy as backup, which is what other jurisdictions had to resort to). There is NO justifiable reason to protect by law and zoning the owners of multimillion dollar properties. Over time, this density should automatically increase, too, as population increases.2. significantly increase investments in co-op/social/rental housing - yes this means taxes have to go up or the taxes levied on these projects (e.g., rental) will need to go down  (all levels of government), 3. increase property taxes, to increase the 'holding cost' of r/E as an investment vehicle, offset by income taxes. Right now, it's reversed: as the value of a property asset goes up, the proportion of the asset paid in property taxes decreases (municipal/provincial)4. limit the capital gains exemption on selling of your primary residence (federal govt) - let's say $1m tax free 5. encourage and incentivize buildings to be maintained/upgraded, rather than knocked down and rebuilt (all levels have a role to play here). Buildings can last way longer than we currently allow, but we make it profitable to knock things down that are still perfectly good, including by rezoning low-rise affordable areas (the Broadway Plan is a perfect example of this, with focused development pressure going to be applied to the affordable apartment areas of Kits and Mt Pleasant)People who think banning foreign buyers entirely is somehow going to fix this are just dumb. Or banning immigration entirely. Which, sure, might reduce the rate of increase slightly if you're super short sighted, but will not get us out of this problem and would create an absolute massive problem in most other areas of our economy and society.",,7,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qtx4pb/do_you_you_think_the_federal_provincial_municipal/hkmmmuo/,2021-11-14 19:58:23,2021,11,14

So people would be expected to do a very nominal deposit (less than $5000). Then people rent for 2-4 years, with every dollar going to their down payment. Once they have the down payment, they use that to qualify for a mortgage. Those who can't get a conventional mortgage, but who paid every month on time and followed strata rules get a cmhc backed mortgage for 5 years until they can be eligible for a conventional mortgage.Cities are already mandating programs like these in new developments (although RBC is doing pre-qualified mortgages and there's no government administration).",,4,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qtx4pb/do_you_you_think_the_federal_provincial_municipal/hkmspi4/,2021-11-14 20:36:30,2021,11,14

Though they can’t change it unless there is approval by local people. Local people regardless of who they vote for veto changes to increase the amount of housing as they’re concerned it will ruin their neighborhood. This makes progress slow.Zoning types, the Greater Vancouver Area encourages high rises, these are incredibly expensive to build and insure. Politicians could encourage low rises and allow for more quadplexes, octaplexes, etc. These smaller buildings are dense, cheaper to build and insure.Interest rates, the government cannot control interest rates. Canada’s interest rates are low and have been historically low during the entire ramp up in housing prices.Speculation, the government can introduce laws to curb second properties/homes. This would likely increase rent while reducing the cost to buy as there would be less places to rent from. (My guess; rent may go down too)Foreign Investment, while not having a huge impact on the local market, it does have an impact. Steps could be taken beyond what we have now, such as only allowing PR/Citizens to buy, or require proof of income taxes paid in BC to buy.Additionally, decreasing prices would be awful for anyone already on the property ladder as they’d have more debt than their property is worth.This isn’t a complete list and was drawn from memory, so some things may be wrong :)",,1,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qtx4pb/do_you_you_think_the_federal_provincial_municipal/hkoe2be/,2021-11-15 03:33:30,2021,11,15

406,no,vancouver,glister,Cost of Evo vs. owning a car in Vancouver,"It really depends on your usage.If you don't commute, you don't need it for work, and you do not get out of town every weekend with your car, Evo is usually cheaper.Let's work it out based on real budget sheets today. I own a RAV4, it's a 2006. It's fucking bullet proof. 200k kms right now, I've had to repair it once in five years. I'll also adjust it to give you an idea of what a Honda Fit/Toyota Yaris might cost. These are probably the most economical car to own, hands down. Lowest depreciation, lowest maintenance costs, for only a little more up front. I've owned both (Well, it was an Echo).Depreciation. People never factor this in well. You buy a reliable used car today, you will need to spend 7-10k. It's costing you at least $1,000/year between opportunity cost (at least 500 right there), and the value dropping (at least 500/year, probably more) (in normal times). **$80/month**Insurance: We pay $2,000 living in East Van. My partner only has three years of driving experience so our rate is higher, could be as low as $1,500. **$120/month**Gas: I drive a V6 doing 20-24mpg. And I drive a lot, 25-30k/year. That is translating to 300-400/month. A Honda Civic would maybe be **$200-250/month**.Maintenance: This isn't fixing your car. This is simply keeping it alive. Every year you're going to drop, at minimum, $1,000 bucks on something. List of things that need maintenance just for driving it: brakes, tires, air filters, oil, various fluids (transmission, coolant). If you don't drop $1,000 this year, you'll drop $1,500 next year. I typically budget $1,400/year, but the ol' V6 requires two quarts more oil and has discs on all four corners for brakes. Little things like that increase your maintenance costs. Let's call it at **$90/month.**More complicated vehicles can also have timing belts, turbos, and additional maintenance for their systems.Parking: Total wildcard here. If you don't have a spot in your building, you could be adding $100/month just to have the car. If you drive it places, you will pay for parking.

Whether it’s property prices or rent prices, we all feel aggrieved about it in one way or another. Cost for other things isn’t too bad in all honesty. It’s not cheap but it’s also not so ridiculously expensive that it isn’t worth being here. Things that cost a lot more than they should are cell phone plans. Car insurance, people tend to be unhappy about but I’d say it’s in line for most people just about nowadays. It’s not a good deal but the recent changes to the governments insurance model has been slightly helpful. Positives are the scenery, climate ( we get all 4 seasons ), food choices, proximity to what I would argue are the 3 best states in the US for weekends away ( Washington, Oregon, California).

Canadian borders won’t take that shit either, just get him/her to visit you instead in Australia. It’s extremely suspicious that y’all would meet in Canada (halfway across the world for you and not much for her but still) despite you being barred from the US over “technicality” reasons. That’s an expensive trip just to see each other when she could go to Australia with you staying home. I call major BS. Meet somewhere else if this partner is real, other than that, the only other two reasons you would be barred from the US/Canada (if you attempted) is planing to work without a visa or have a criminal record. Stay the fuck out of the Canada. We don’t need that shit. “Oh I’m seeing my partner, when I actually plan to work and live illegally here” We welcome immigrants and people who are relocated due to war or 3-2nd world countries/regions. Not people who want to work illegally and live here without paying taxes. Taking away that opportunity away from immigrants who need that chance. It it to my understanding if you got denied by the US for obvious reasons (working illegally or planning to overstay your welcome), you will be denied by the Canadian border.

Some things to consider:- housing: if you're renting a 2 bed condo it would cost you well over 2k in Vancouver and slightly over 2k in cities around Vancouver. Buying would cost more (plus a foreign buyer tax if you are not a Canafian citizen).- living expenses: grocery 800, heating (hydro and or Fortis BC) 200 - 300, mobile phone at least 50/ea, internet+TV 150.- commuting: vehicle lease/financing (this i have no idea what your plans may be), insurance ~1500/yr if you qualify for a better rate with ICBC (with 0 discount it could be 3000+ annually), fuel $300 if you only do local driving at around 30 to 40km daily and you have a gas efficient vehicle.So, with 80k income, after paying tax, you should be able to pay all bills...  etc but won't really have enough to allow you to dine out frequently and vacation would take some extra planning.However, is it worth it?

425,no,vancouver,torodonn,Would you recommend moving here?,"I am unsure why, as an American couple, Vancouver is one of the places you're considering. Honestly, if you want the Pacific Northwest, you can move to Seattle or the outlying suburbs without the hassle of immigration. (I actually read your post a couple of times to make sure  you weren't considering moving to Vancouver, Washington instead). As a couple with 3 jobs that combine to $80k, it is a realistic issue whether any immigration application will be successful.If you're really determined to try Vancouver though, it is a really nice city with a high standard of life. Moving here from the Midwest, the mountains and ocean and the mild winters should be pretty amazing. It is expensive though and $80k/yr is doable but I'd say you both would be financially much more comfortable where you are. You could move out to our burbs but honestly, housing prices are going to be high even an hour out of town, especially relative to local wages.Old age here is likely not a lot better than the States financially. Our retirement pensions are mostly inadequate though we may have more social services. Not having to worry about health care expenses is probably the biggest plus. I will say that because of transit and high density, Vancouver generally feels a little more senior friendly than suburban America though.

425,no,vancouver,Sleuthin___,Would you recommend moving here?,"Hi OP. I hope you’re enjoying your weekend.Vancouver and surrounding communities are very beautiful. Ocean, beaches, mountains, parks, lakes, hiking, skiing, amenities, concerts & pro sports, lots of diversity and culture, great restaurants etc all contribute to this. The quality of life is amazing.I live in the downtown core of Vancouver and the COL is very high; it’s currently the least affordable city in North America actually. It is personally worth it to me now because I love the ocean, but it may not be forever.To lease a nice newer condo in the downtown core (1 bedroom with a very small home office - entire unit totalling about 550 sq ft), you’re looking at probably $2200/month minimum just in rent. Often you have to pay extra for a storage unit in the building ($100/month) and a parking spot ($200/month) plus your insurance & utilities. To purchase something at that size would be in the $600 - $700k range or even higher. Not sure if the $80k you cited is USD or not. Not my business obviously, but I was thinking that if you work remotely and retain a USD salary that’s an advantage to consider.The outlying communities/burbs were more affordable years ago, but they have either caught up or are about to with a few exceptions.A relative (senior citizen) lives in a very nice but not extravagant townhouse complex in Langley, which is over an hour from Vancouver. Her place is well-built and I think it’s about 30 years old. 2 big bedrooms and a really nice floor plan; very small yard. Her neighbours who have an identical layout just sold theirs for about $1.3 million. A lot of detached homes out that way are higher. I would never dissuade anyone from following their wish to live here; just be prepared of course as with any move. In addition to Vancouver, I would recommend looking at other cities/towns in BC. I grew up in northern BC and will likely return one day. COVID & working from home has seen a lot of people relocating to more northerly parts to be able to purchase a house/big lot and actually have some “fun money” after the bills are paid. There’s some true gems in our province that are getting their due more recently because they are much more affordable than Vancouver but are also very beautiful. There was a great thread in this sub last week about the best towns in BC; if you can’t find it just drop a reply and I’ll link it for you.Cheers!

Everyone's got their volunteering on hold and any indoor sports groups on the backburner and waiting until things improve maybe next year to return to other hobbies that involve sharing air with strangers.  It's been a big 2 year hibernation, basically.   That said - especially once things are more open again - would suggest looking into volunteering in things you're passionate about that require learning skills with others or taking classes or joining team sports.

Templeton STEM is open to all kids and it's an amazing program. I have a kid taking AP English and she's just happy that finally there is a class with kids that are interested.  It's not fun being in a class where no one has read the book when you are really into it but don't want to be the only one talking.

I think the competition thing needs to be unpacked more.The west side ones are competitive because it's believed that West side = better. So it's really just competitive for people who are classist. I think that the mini schools should focus attention on taking in kids who struggle in school because the tight knit cohort system can build a strong sense of camaraderie. The one thing that is very correct in the article is the costs. I had to get a second job to pay for my kids to go on the trips in their programs.

461,no,vancouver,torodonn,"Feel unsafe in my apartment, building managers don't care","It sucks you don't feel safe in your own home but there's a real limit to what your building manager can do. In most building budgets, security can only be a stopgap for an immediate situation (e.g. break in attempt broke a door lock, damage an alarm, etc) Unless there's a reason to believe there's an ongoing threat to building security, it would have to be considered against the budget. It's entirely possible that your building is still considering security but not in the form of urgently posting a guard outside the building in response to a break in attempt, but rather seeking quotes and looking whether there's a service that is affordable and provides some benefit in the upcoming annual strata budget.More realistically, you can identify if there are things that make your second floor unit unsafe. A while ago, our complex had a break in where the intruder was hopping onto planters over a low railing on a publicly accessible walkway. We have since added gates to limit access to that walkway. However, it definitely looks like the police did their job in this case and the threat was handled. Honestly, the idea that the police were immediately responsive and came within 4 minutes should give you some comfort. You can't prevent all potential threats from happening but no one was hurt, the criminal didn't get access to the building and any damage can be handled via insurance.",,56,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qsgtpk/feel_unsafe_in_my_apartment_building_managers/hkdi3zo/,2021-11-12 20:21:51,2021,11,12

With buying; you’re putting equity into something monthly, however costs are extremely high with strata fees (upwards of additional $500-600/month) on top of your mortgage and insurance. Possibility it may prevent you from investing and or other things you want to do. With renting- you’re paying a lower flat fee and don’t have the headache of additional expenses. However, your money is not building equity. For me. I would put aside this additional money that you would use for the mortgage into an investment or fund that can grow 8-9% yearly.  Some cases owning would maybe be a bit cheaper than renting however with the insurance laws changing and strata now having to charge a lot more, it’s tough. Also property taxes going up.

469,no,vancouver,M-------,Is it better to buy a Condo than rent an Aparment in Vancouver in 2021?,"Over the years, I've seen a number of times when it was a *bad time* to buy.  Right now is a *bad time.*There will be better buying opportunities in the future.  Insanely low mortgage rates have been driving the market this year, but those low rates are ending.  FOMO is strong especially this fall: people with rate-holds have to buy a place in the next couple months or so, or they'll face higher interest rates.  This is the market's final way of pushing buyers to buy.  Once rates rise, buyer interest will decline, and buyers who normally would've bought next year (but who instead advanced their timeline and bought this year) won't be looking to buy.This may mean a modest decline in prices, or perhaps just calmer buying conditions.  Either way, it'll make for a better time to buy than now.In the spring of 2018, I sold my condo.  Rates were rising, and roughly around the time when rate holds would've been ending, I remember that we went from 2-3 showings per week, to our realtor getting zero calls.  ZERO.  The market died practically overnight.  We were lucky to find a buyer at near-peak prices.  I bought a house half a year later for below-assessment (and ~30% below what comparable places sold for in the spring of 2018).  My interest rate seems absurdly high (3.5%) compared to recent rates, but I'm pretty sure the increased rates will cause the market to seize.",,2,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qs4ith/is_it_better_to_buy_a_condo_than_rent_an_aparment/hkbdmgj/,2021-11-12 09:56:12,2021,11,12

I have a condo right now and the other fees amount to about another $6k a year. Also, if you're going to own, make sure to keep a buffer. At the very least, you'll want to keep some money on hand in case there's an assessment for repairs or something or for your own emergency repairs.

I could teach her, but instructor lessons would probably be more valuable for her. She has been up several years ago but only to the bunny hill, and found Cypress' bunny hill a bit steep/intimidating to learn on.So Cypress (which I'm most familiar with) is probably out for us at the moment.Grouse requiring the vax makes it more appealing, but from reading [this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/qm26oq/grouse_seymour_or_cypress_the_best_options/) and elsewhere, I suspect it's not the best for beginners.She has never gone to Whistler and really wants to at some point, but during the pandemic is [probably not the best time](https://old.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/qodg98/lack_of_vaccine_mandate_at_bcs_whistler_ski/). So Whistler can wait.I keep seeing that Seymour is great for beginners, and it seems to also be the best price-wise. So in the lower mainland, maybe it's a good option for us, but I'm not sure about crowds.I also keep hearing that Big White and Sun Peaks are great mountains to visit, as they're much less crowded in general. We'll have some time off around when the mountains first open. I have winter tires and AWD + might get chains if necessary, and we may go up for a week or so (weather-permitting). It's also attractive to us as a mini getaway, without having to fly. Kelowna's probably more attractive in this respect, as there seems to be more stuff to see. I get the impression that Sun Peaks is better for beginners and in general, mountain-wise.The COVID outbreak at Big White last year gives us some pause, as does the case count spike from a couple months ago, although things appear to be much better now. I do get the impression there are more anti-vaxxers there though.Can anyone offer any other insight safety-wise, and as far as beginner-friendliness goes?

Which one?,"FleetOptics is truly the worst - I've only had them deliver for Sephora when Canada Post can't.  They sometimes won't call, sometimes they do.  Sometimes they buzz, sometimes they don't.  Whats worse is that they only attempt 3 times before they return to sender, and they don't leave any pick up tags at all.  So if you happen to be away for whatever reason, in the bathroom, in a call or meeting while WFH etc. and you miss them you are super SOL.  They also won't do any package re-routing. Intelcom is also just as bad.  Cut from the same cloth, it seems.  Purolator also brutal and every time I've missed them I've had to go out to basically the airport to pick up the package, despite them having other locations in Vancouver.Wait a second...they are all awful.",,29,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qrqa3c/anyone_else_having_horrible_experiences_with/hk8ghzm/,2021-11-11 18:48:24,2021,11,11

Which one?,"I used to work for one of the delivery companies, it was a super fun job but some people expect the world without doing the bare minimum to help out their delivery driver.  If you live in an apartment YOU NEED TO PUT THE BUZZER AND UNIT NUMBER IN THE SECOND LINE OF THE ADDRESS.  The buzzer number is part of your address, just as much as the postal code.During Christmas time this is non-negotiable because we work an insane amount of overtime and with the amount of time it would take to scroll through everyone’s gongshow of a buzzer panel (seriously, if you’re looking for something to do, actually scroll through the thing and see how disorganized they are), hardly anything would get done.  A package lacking a buzzer number during our busy season wouldn’t even leave the station, it would be marked as a “wrong address” and sent to customer service for follow up.A frequent offender is the person who complains we didn’t buzz, but the package is, for example, addressed to “Lisa Brown.”  Im only going to look under the L’s and the B’s for your buzzer #, so if it’s listed under “Dave and Lisa,” Im not going to see it.Anyways, there’s bad apples and awesome people in every profession.

Purolator we referred to as ""sooner or later"" because although the local deliveries were ok, the out of town stuff had issues. Often their system would ok a delivery address and then we'd be charged a return fee because the address wasn't part of the purchase delivery area. Shipping to Ontario or Quebec is definitely a no-no because they have a 80+% error rate.UPS we didn't have a contract with, we only received but everything came smashed like they drove over it before they put it in the truck.

510,yes,vancouver,kpn315,Lower Mainland’s construction industry near historical lows due to labour shortage and will only get worse,"Via VRCA (Vancouver Regional Construction Association)To meet project demand, the Lower Mainland’s construction workforce needs to increase by 7,500 skilled trades workers over the next two years. At the same time, it will lose 4,800 to retirement, bringing the total recruitment demand to nearly 12,300 workers. Based on historical trends, we can anticipate that 4,900 new workers under the age of 30 will enter the Lower Mainland industry during this period, leaving a shortfall of nearly 7,300 workers by late 2021. The shortfall is forecast to be nearly 17,500 workers by 2029.The provincial forecast is also troubling: B.C.’s construction industry will be short 11,700 workers over the next two years and some 23,000 workers short by 2029.Building a sustainable workforce will require the industry to increase recruitment from groups traditionally underrepresented in the current construction labour force, including women, Indigenous workers and new Canadians.Investing in training and apprenticeships is needed to avoid potential skills shortages over the long term, however, it will not address the immediate need for skilled trades workers.To meet the near-term demand for labour, the Lower Mainland needs people tooled up and ready to go now. As such, most near-term labour force needs will likely need to be drawn from outside the province, outside of Canada or outside the industry.[https://www.vrca.ca/advocacy/skilled-labour-shortage/](https://www.vrca.ca/advocacy/skilled-labour-shortage/)",195,187,0.92,Local News,/r/vancouver/comments/qrdw89/lower_mainlands_construction_industry_near/,2021-11-11 05:29:10,2021,11,11

510,no,vancouver,ExcuseGeneral826,Lower Mainland’s construction industry near historical lows due to labour shortage and will only get worse,"A consortium of contractors are trying to saturate the market with temporary workers - all a ploy to lower wages.Some interesting facts the VRCA has omitted:* There are currently HORDES of illegal workers throughout the construction industry.* It is extremely hard to get a job that pays even just $20/hour for a young inexperienced worker who otherwise works hard and is competent. Remember that construction jobs wear out equipment faster than other jobs: You need to replace your boots and tools at your own cost. A $20 construction job is effectively minimum wage once you factor in wear and tear both on your body and equipment.* Temp agencies are paying $15/hr for HARD work. Showing up at 5:00 am at one ""non-profit"" doesn't guarantee a would-be worker even a full shift at that $15/hr. Never has someone had to work for such low wages (relative to spending power) in a hard construction job in the modern era.* Many very competent tradesmen cannot get into a trades program for the life of them. The reason being that a contractor absolutely cannot let their best guys go for 6 weeks per year in order to take the trades program. You can challenge levels but it's convoluted. In fact the best way to get ticketed is to suck at your job and constantly be on and off EI. Many would-be tradesmen cannot quit their job, cannot get laid off (and if they do, it will be very unexpected), and therefore will never have a chance to get ticketed.* The folk tales about attractive pay rates come with two caveats: Many are 'insider' jobs where the typical person's resume won't even be considered, and many are wages obtained by people who entered the industry and an opportune time (in otherwords, they don't reflect what's achievable for a young worker entering today's construction workforce).* Many contractors are earning very high profits yet paying rock-bottom wages. Other's are disorganized shit shows that somehow earn enough to get by (and likewise, pay the lowest possible wages).* Many contractors are putting out job ads stating they have LMIA's allowing them to take on foreign workers. These same contractors ignore local resumes (in other words, something's fishy with the immigration system here).There seems to be a prevailing trend which isn't simply exclusive to the construction industry: When labour is in high demand, local employers are choosing to import workers instead of raising wages.",,3,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qrdw89/lower_mainlands_construction_industry_near/hk8je8v/,2021-11-11 19:07:46,2021,11,11

514,yes,vancouver,chibanganthro,Question about BC healthcare for temporary resident,"Hello all,I'm over on Vancouver Island. I'm a non-resident Canadian who has not lived in Canada since I was child, never paid taxes here, and have never worked here. My parents live here, though, and we usually spend summers here. I have a research leave from my university abroad for a year, and since we planned to spend 6 months here in Canada and 6 months in a 3rd country, we weren't planning on enrolling in BC Health. This is because I read that provincial insurance is intended for people here 6 months or longer. We bought fairly comprehensive travel medical, but that doesn't cover routine visits, of course--it's intended for urgent care or emergency.Due to the country we were planning to move on to still not being open to visitors during the pandemic, we are now planning on staying in Canada for my full sabbatical, through August 2022. So now I'm wondering about signing up for BC Health. My questions are:1) If you're here longer than 6 months are you required to sign up for BC Health? Or is it just recommended? (I'm imagining the latter, as I don't know how they would enforce mandatory enrollment). 2) We arrived in Canada in August, which means that we've been here 3 months, the waiting period for getting enrolled in BC Health. But does that 3 months start from the date we entered, or would we have had to get in the system when we entered (some kind of official declaration)? 3) I'm assuming that enrolling for BC Health will mean that we need to file/pay taxes in Canada, something we have not had to do before. This is only fair--I am just trying to figure out how complicated and expensive that might be for a year here, for my daughter and I. We already have to file taxes in the US every year because we are dual US citizens, and also in Korea where we have permanent residency (and work). 4) One reason I want to get signed up for BC Health ASAP is that while we (US citizen husband and myself) got vaccinated for COVID without problems, I cannot get my daughter pre-registered in the system for the COVID vaxx for kids 5-11. When I called the line they said that they cannot give her a personal health number until the vaxx is officially approved for that age group, so no pre-registering for us. So that brings me to how we should actually get signed up--is calling the thing to do? Or make an appointment at Services Canada ?Thanks so much for any advice.",11,0,0.42,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qrawfd/question_about_bc_healthcare_for_temporary/,2021-11-11 02:42:40,2021,11,11

527,no,vancouver,bridgemixture,Benevolent and Friendship Societies in Chinatown,"Here's some information about a similar organization in Victoria:>The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association - Early headquarters of the Chinese across Canada>The first of its kind in Canada, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) was formed in Victoria by 31 local groups in 1884 to protect the rights and safety of Chinese immigrants.>A number of discriminatory laws were passed in British Columbia in the 1870s and 1880s, leading up to the formation of the CCBA. Chinese and First Nations residents were disenfranchised at the provincial level and in Victoria in the 1870s, meaning that governments did not have to take their interests into account. The city and province also excluded Chinese workers from employment on public works projects. In February 1884, the provincial government passed legislation intending to stop Chinese immigration, tax Chinese residents yearly, and prevent them from purchasing land. In addition, acts of violence were carried out by white residents against Chinese residents, with little or no consequence.>Chinatown had a number of small clan and county associations concerned with social welfare but no overall organization that would protect the interests of Chinese residents. In the spring of 1884, merchants in Victoria’s Chinatown received approval from the Chinese consul-general of San Francisco to set up an umbrella organization that would act as a Chinese consulate in Canada. It was named Zhonghua Huiguan or the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association.>The CCBA sent requests to Chinese communities for donations from all Chinese residents, and published a constitution in July 1884. The objectives of the association were to inform Chinese residents about Canadian laws, protect them from discrimination through legal means, deal internally with crimes in Chinatown through arbitration between members, and assist the weak and the sick. By 1885, the CCBA had raised sufficient funds to construct a three-storey association building.>Originally headed by wealthy merchants, the CCBA developed a more democratic and diverse leadership in the early twentieth century. New political, clan and county organizations in the late 1890s and early 1900s started to compete with the CCBA for authority within Chinatown and the loyalty of residents. Representatives of these organizations joined the board of the CCBA and sometimes factions developed. Small business owners started to join the ranks of the leadership of the CCBA but they had fewer funds available to donate for expenses such as taxes and building maintenance. With the increasing importance of Vancouver as a port in the early twentieth century, a new Chinese Benevolent Association was formed in that city which looked less to the Victoria CCBA for leadership. Over time, the authority of the CCBA was limited to Vancouver Island and Chinese residents in smaller communities across Canada.>In the twentieth century, the CCBA continued to pursue its mandate of protecting the interests of Chinese residents, resolving disputes within the community, and providing welfare services. As a defender of the rights of Chinese Canadians, the CCBA lobbied against discriminatory legislation such as the head tax, segregated schooling, and laws that prohibited Chinese business owners from hiring white women. As a welfare institution, the CCBA raised funds for a school, hospital and cemetery, and provided legal aid for Chinese residents.>During the Second World War, there was increasing cooperation between Chinese and Anglo-European Canadians, who were allies in this conflict. For example, the CCBA raised donations for the Canadian Red Cross, while the Committee for Medical Aid for China in Victoria purchased wheat and sent it to China. After the war, some of the intense racism in Canadian society toward Chinese Canadians started to fade. Chinese residents could become Canadian citizens in 1947, and more Chinese Canadians started to settle outside of Chinatown. The gradual integration of Chinese citizens into Canadian society made the CCBA less necessary as an intermediary. To increase community participation, the CCBA formed clubs for youth and invited the involvement of women on the board for the first time in 1959.>Chinatown was in decline in the 1960s. Some buildings were no longer being maintained, or only the ground floor served as a shop while the upper floors were vacant. In 1962, the City of Victoria purchased buildings from Cormorant Street, tore them down, and created Centennial Square in their place. Dr. David Chuenyan Lai surveyed Chinatown in 1971 and found that it had decreased to two city blocks and housed mostly elderly men and low-income young families. Just a decade later, Chinatown underwent a successful revitalization. The CCBA was a driving force behind a project headed by Dr. Lai to rehabilitate the heritage buildings of Chinatown and install the Gate of Harmonious Interest. The CCBA closed the Chinese Hospital and created a committee to build a five-storey apartment building for subsidized housing on Fisgard Street, called the Chung Wah Mansion.>Over time, the authority of the CCBA has become more symbolic as it faces the challenges of relating to a diversifying Chinese population in Victoria. Nevertheless, the CCBA continues to support charitable causes and the preservation of Chinese culture and language in Victoria.>The CCBA Moves the Palace of the Saints into the Chinese Public School>In the 1950s, strong prejudice against Chinese Canadians was starting to fade and the federal government began to relax immigration restrictions. Ironically, at a time when more Chinese immigrants were moving to Victoria, membership in the CCBA and attendance at the Chinese Public School were declining since new immigrants chose to live outside of Chinatown and to educate their children primarily in English. In 1965, the Dart Coon Club moved out of the old CCBA building and the temple shrine, or Palace of the Saints in the top floor, was unprotected. The next year, the CCBA moved the temple shrine to the hall of the Chinese Public School, in a ceremony directed by CCBA president Jack Lee.>Palace of the Saints: Headquarters of Popular Religions in Victoria's Chinatown>The Palace of the Saints (or Sages) is a shrine and altar, made in South China from pieces that fit together without nails or screws, and brought to Canada in 1885. It contains statuettes of historical and legendary figures respected for their acts and wisdom: Confucius (China’s most famous philosopher), Tian Hou (the Queen of Heaven), Zhao Yuan Tan (the God of Wealth), Kwan Yu (the God of the Military), and Hua Tuo (the God of Medicine). The shrine was first installed in the third floor of the CCBA building. Chinese residents and travellers would pay their respects at the shrine and school children assembled there before their classes began. In 1966, the CCBA moved the Palace of the Saints to the assembly room of the Chinese Public School.https://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=chinese_consolidated_benevolent_association.html",,6,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qr3cpq/benevolent_and_friendship_societies_in_chinatown/hk5alkb/,2021-11-11 01:30:35,2021,11,11

I stopped him and he said he s been waiting for 6 minutes so he had to cancel. And he left ! Just like that !

544,no,vancouver,avocado_rollzz,Renting with pets,"Please don’t come for me, I love Vancouver, but - for a city who is recognized as one of North America’s most dog friendly cities, it can be extremely difficult to find housing that accommodates or allows pets.A fair amount of landlords who rent their homes have a strict “no pet” policy, which fair enough, it’s their home, but sometimes they budge provided it’s the right person, with a sufficient pet resume and after getting to meet the pet themselves before making a decision.The bigger challenge IMO is that a large portion of the rentals available in Vancouver are Strata properties. Many of the Strata corporations have pet bylaws that can be very challenging because they limit the total number of pets allowed, the size, type or breed of pet, or prohibit pets all together - which are all enforced and nonnegotiable.Keep trying though, because it is possible! I’d first seek out basement suites, floor level units, houses etc before anything Strata, make your pets a cute/fun resume of sorts, one that includes their photo, personality details, age, size etc with some solid references and then even suggest prospect landlords to meet them to see for themselves.Also, some neighbourhoods that I feel you’d have more luck in with finding a pet lenient apartment (because you mentioned apartment) don’t always advertise their vacancy online, but instead the old fashioned way of having a “vacancy: 1 bedroom/2 bedroom available” etc on the lawn out front with a phone number to call for inquires. If it’s an option for you at all, I’d almost suggest making a day of going around and seeing what’s available and calling around that way.",,13,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qqmj7o/renting_with_pets/hk1pj77/,2021-11-10 08:47:48,2021,11,10

560,no,vancouver,rando_commenter,Plan to Road Trip from Vancouver BC to L.A. What should I know?,"I've made the trip and I used to live in LA for a few years.If you want to staight-line it on the I-5, the most reasonable way to do it is to split it into two days and overnight in Redding, which is a big truck stop town for pretty much the same reasons. Even then, start your first day from Vancouver as early as you can, because you'll arrive after dark. The big hurdle on Day 1 will be the Mt. Shasta Park region just before you get to Redding, it's up the mountain and down again, so yes, have proper snow-tires and/or plan ahead and find another route. The last time I did this route it was a torrential rainstorm and just after dark around 6pm, and you have to weave in and out of all of the semis.From Redding to LA is smooth sailing on the 5. In fact, it's stupendously boring, road is straight and the horizon is completely flat.When you get to the mountains north of LA you're going to through the grapevine, so it's another mountain climb and down again. It's pretty steep in sections, in summer time it's advisable to turn off your a/c if you have a small car.Once you get into LA, your drive depends heavily on whether it's rush hour or not. General rule of thumb for a newbie is to say in the middle lane of the highway because exits can either be on the left side or the right side. Don't worry, US highway signs are way better than Canadian highway signs, they're more legible and give you more warning about approaching exits.General tips:\- There are rest stations up and down the I-5. Take advantage of them every chance you get to stretch your legs and pee. They are staff by some of the nicest people and will sometimes have cookies and coffee.\- Stay out of the left lane unless passing. You don't realize how undisciplined Vancouver drivers are about this until you leave and go south.\- Don't follow semis too closely. No matter how much space you think you are giving them, fall back further than that. Your windshield will thank you.\-",,7,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qqavlo/plan_to_road_trip_from_vancouver_bc_to_la_what/hjzcr8e/,2021-11-09 20:45:07,2021,11,9

560,no,vancouver,Journo_JB,Plan to Road Trip from Vancouver BC to L.A. What should I know?,"I’ve driven the stretch of I-5 between northern Calif and Disneyland MANY times. I’m from the Bay Area and had a yearly pass to Disney. If you’ve never seen Disney during the holidays, it’s truly something special. I-5 through Calif is the easiest drive you could make. From the Bay Area to Disney it’s quite literally flat and straight the entire drive (about 6 hours if you follow the flow of left-lane traffic. If you plan to drive the speed limit, please please move over to the right lane and expect an extra hour or so or drive time.) (also, this estimate is based on my drives, which were always between 2am-8am when there were very few cars on the road) If you have time, plan a stopover in San Francisco (I’m happy to advise on that too if you want to shoot me a msg). If you’re just looking to rest, eat dinner at a restaurant, sleep at a motel and hit the road again, I would suggest Sacramento. There’s nothing in that city worth seeing, it’s just a convenient stopover. While it is possible to get a ticket for speeding in California, the posted speed limit is treated as more of a suggestion, and many people go about 10-15 over. I can’t stress this enough: If you plan to drive exactly the speed limit, I highly urge you to keep to the right with the slower traffic. CA drivers are aggressive as hell. I always did the drive at night, on the road at 2 or 3am. In Anaheim by 8am. very few cars on the road. You’ll want to strategically plan what time you get into Los Angeles because traffic can be brutal there. Pay attention to signs indicating how far to the nearest Rest Stop, that will be where you can nap, stretch your legs and use the washroom. If you have children, bring a roll of toilet paper and wet wipes because while there are many gas stations along the way, there are long stretches of freeway where you won’t find a place to stop for a while. Plan accordingly. You’ll want to pay *very* close attention to the Grapevine. The Grapevine is the stretch of I-5 that winds through the mountains that separate central Calif and southern Calif. If I remember correctly it’s about a 40 min drive straight through but because it’s high elevation, winding, and crawling with big-rigs, it can be treacherous. It also shuts down a few times every winter because of snow. So you’ll want to track Grapevine conditions and weather in the weeks leading up to your trip. Driving down to LA in the winter requires a bit of flexibility or at the very least a contingency plan for a Grapevine shutdown. I would honestly suggest flying and save yourself the worry (and money).The weather at Disney during winter is beautiful! I’ve never been rained on there during the holidays. Bring a sweater and a light jacket and plan to layer. Temperatures drop a LOT as soon as the sun sets, but you’ll want to stick around for the light shows at night.

560,no,vancouver,Novel-Pop4415,Plan to Road Trip from Vancouver BC to L.A. What should I know?,The Oregon coast / California is such an amazing road trip. I’d recommend taking the 101 down starting at Portland or even earlier if you have the time. It is much more scenic and memorable than the I-5 but will obviously add time but is worth it in my opinion. We hit the I-5 hard on the way home and got back in about 2 days.We did it pretty spontaneously and tried to do it a bit old school by not having a data plan and instead used physical maps and asked strangers directions etc. We also didn’t pre book any hotels and instead booked them the day we arrived. This was a bit scary when we were at Starbucks in Portland or IKEA in Oakland at 7:00 at night trying to book a hotel using their wifi on Hotwire for that night lol but this made the trip all the more memorable. Here are a few more noteworthy items from our trip: -Klamath/redwoods/Avenue of the Giants is very cool.-Evergreen air museum after Portland has the Spruce goose and a bunch of cool NASA space stuff if your into that.-All of the small towns along the Oregon coast are great.-Santa cruise / Monterey Bay area is really nice.-Harris ranch in is a nice place to stay.-Check out Hearst Castle if it’s open.-San Francisco was insanely expensive the week we were there. Hotel that my parents paid $125 a night for the week before was $700 a night the week we were there. I think it fluctuates by the week if there are events etc. it is also cold /foggy/windy there and very busy.I also did it in the summer so it might be a bit of a different experience this time of year and with Covid.Have fun!,,2,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qqavlo/plan_to_road_trip_from_vancouver_bc_to_la_what/hk1synm/,2021-11-10 09:38:13,2021,11,10

Had roof access to a building a long time ago and it was great, go have a quiet smoke, look at the view, listen to the hum of the city.  Walked super quiet, stayed away from things that shouldn't be walked on, didn't make a peep.  Then I made the mistake of bringing up a very large drunk friend one night whose walking and braying noise level is somewhere around that of a draft horse.

And everyone I've talked to from Toronto said, ""Oh at least, it would less expensive than Vancouver!"" If one more person tells me that, I'm going to lose it.Toronto is way more expensive than Vancouver, and I'm talking about downtown Van. For starters, my car insurance for the same coverage as I had in Van (all the bells and whistles) costs me about $25/month more in Toronto. Not terrible but considering that BC is known for ridiculously high insurance prices, was not what I expected.Groceries, restaurants, hydro, utilities, everything is noticeably more expensive! And even rent! With the pandemic, rent in Vancouver has taken a dip, and even before, if you looked a little outside downtown, like Richmond or Burnaby or Surrey, rent was significantly cheaper and you're still a hop and a skip away from downtown. Rent in Toronto is nasty right now, and the fact that people put offers to rent places is not even heard of in BC.And all this expense doesn't really come with a whole lot of benefits. Yes, Toronto is a world-class city, but so is Vancouver. Vancouver is just not as diverse. But it's much nicer and you're a day trip away from so many beautiful places. I've travelled to my fair share of big cities and one thing that I look for is the little unique experiences that you can find that sets the city apart from its counterparts. And Toronto has very few of those. It's just a big city, that's it. It lacks character.I can't wait till I put my time in at work, gain the experience for my resume and then jet back to BC or someplace else.",57,42,0.71,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qq7rru/moving_from_vancouver_to_toronto_read_before_you/,2021-11-09 16:47:02,2021,11,9

Since they use the same light fixture, there's way less upfront cost.  They would only need to be active during rush hour...

I saw 3 houses that were 1200-1400, all inclusive 1 bedroom spaces(you can try for bachelors too as they are usually cheaper). It’s possible but it’s hard as there’s a lot of renters and not a lot of places. It’s honestly all about timing in this instance as well as putting out key information. In your message say your name, age, what you do and a hobby or two. Say you’re fully vaccinated if you are. Include a phone number and email address they can contact you on, it will all make you seem trustworthy and they are more likely to get back to you.Don’t count out Craigslist, just be smart. It’s probably like 99% real people and only a small percentage scams. It’s easy enough to tell too as long as you’re smart about it. Don’t send money to anyone without seeing a place, find out if they’re able to rent out the space and who they are. Everywhere there’s always a risk of scam, but again Craigslist I found the best places. They’ll move quick though, you have to have Craigslist open and keep refreshing, most places go within 1 or two days.

595,no,vancouver,wampa604,Dozens arrested in Vancouver police shoplifting clampdown,"Sorta related to all the comments about the lack of penalties -- at a previous job, I worked at a bank, and could see financial transactions of the bank's customers, for fraud reviews etc.One time, I saw a guy clearly committing fraud at numerous retailers.  He worked as a janitor for multiple chain-type stores.  It looked like he was using his access, to steal products (and print out a bogus receipt, as the chains didn't lock down their systems at night I guess), and then he'd return those products at other stores.  Fairly blatant: like a $0.10 purchase at Michaels store 1, followed by a refund on his card of $120 at Michaels store #2.He was doing this for months in the lead up to Christmas, stealing well over $30k.  Guys background had a history of gang relations, he'd gone to jail already for a few years.It gets reported to fintrac of course, but nothing happens.  The bank tried reporting it to the police, but they basically said ""You're not the victim.  You need to get the stores that are being robbed to report it"".  Bank tried reaching out to retailers discretely (""We're seeing some irregularities on these specific transactions, can you take a look?"" sorta thing), and they each, individually, shrugged.  The amount stolen from any one particular store, wasn't enough for them to go to the police -- and the outage was generally just covered by insurance.Bank closed the guys account for the suspicious activity, and that was that.  He prolly kept doing it.Point is, in some of these cases, the distributed nature of the crime makes it appear to victims as a lesser issue.  And the system seems more concerned with 'victim vs criminal' than with 'public good vs criminal'.",,6,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qpqub1/dozens_arrested_in_vancouver_police_shoplifting/hjxwrtr/,2021-11-09 14:57:35,2021,11,9

Personally speaking, whatever culture that inserts the most religion into their daily lives will freak me out the most.

Not to mention, I've heard too many stories about how the men treat women there, and I hear Canadian-born Indians bashing their own families and culture all the time. One young (Indian) woman I know gets triggered if people simply wear the colour brown, so I'll opt to say she didn't have the greatest experience growing up. Indian people themselves are not doing their race much justice since so many of them also dislike it. Refusing to have an Indian neighbour seems extreme though. I think you must be referring to one person in particular who is saying those things, as I doubt any normal person would have an issue with a neighbour who happens to be Indian. It's not like it's easy to find a place to live to begin with, imagine how quickly you'd make yourself homeless being like that, haha.

I spoke with the dude for a while and drove out to meet him to delivery some steel toed work boots. He was legit homeless, and he was trying to get work. IIRC His last few posts were that he finally got a job. He posted sporadically a couple times after that in the homeless subreddit then nothing. I assume he either kept at it in Langley (where I think the job was and where I met him), but also was considering getting to Vancouver Island.Anyway, to the point: I would need some pretty **solid** proof he was a scammer as I *personally* drove him to his homeless camp and spent about an hour with him.(I don't post stuff this personal usually but I have a massive soft spot for anyone trying thier best to improve thier situation). IMO if you sent him money and feel unsure if you did the right thing - consider this message a confirmation he *absolutely* was someone down on his luck and, if my memory of his last posts are correct you are a part of someone's redemption arc.DeerSausage4life was his user name (IIRC)",,36,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qp60gv/looking_for_a_guy_who_lived_in_vancouver_or_on/hjrwuxm/,2021-11-08 06:16:21,2021,11,8

623,no,vancouver,Sleuthin___,How do you guys feel about all the major internet providers in the vancouver/lower mainland area?,TL;DR - Novus is great.I was super happy with Telus for about 10 years. They gave me lots of promo stuff like an iPad & laptop because I also have my mobility account with them.I moved into a 5 year old building in August and was really surprised that Telus isn’t available at this location (near the stadiums). The customer rep was surprised too.Turns out the building is wired for only Shaw or Novus.  Guessing the developer of the condo had a deal with both. I am not a huge fan of Shaw so went with Novus and so far am really pleased. Strong wifi 24/7. Their customer service is very good and doesn’t have huge wait times for an agent when you call. In my experience both Shaw & Telus can have long wait times in the phone queue and the callback feature is not always reliable. There was also no need to have a Novus tech come in to install anything as the condo is set up already - just had to pick up the modem & PVR.,,1,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qp3dvc/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_all_the_major_internet/hjrv1sx/,2021-11-08 05:54:43,2021,11,8

And I just picked up The Only Good Indians (by Stephen Graham Jones) today! So hopefully I enjoy it :)It’s not really the same genre, but if you haven’t read the Red Rising books yet, I HIGHLY recommend them. The first book is a little YA (still very enjoyable and well-written though), but the series really picks up and gets into some darker tones by the 5th book.

Very rare that a book can fuel so many extended branches of thought and daydreams and fascinating discussions with other readers!Also gotta agree with the Three Body Problem recommendations, another one of my favourites with some of the biggest and wildest scifi concepts I've read. I actually just finished the semi-official fourth book, which was actually a piece of fanfic that the original author signed off on and allowed to be published as a sequel of sorts! It's called The Redemption of Time by Baoshu, for any fans who haven't heard of it.

To be honest, I see many of my FT musician friends struggle in this town as the gigs are small and pubs and venues don’t pay you a whole lot. A lot of them teach music to make ends meet as Covid has dried up a lot of gigs due to smaller budgets and restrictions. Even before the pandemic this town was hard on the folk arts. Places I know that are friendly to the music are Donnellan’s, Johnnie Fox’s and the Wolf and Hound. I’m sure when you were here in 2018 you did some gigs at some of those places. There are probably other open mic places you can start (at one point the Corduroy had open mics, but just browse through this Reddit and you can see why everyone here hates them!) Hopefully when things get back to normal there will be more events happening. As mentioned Vancouver Folk Festival is a big one.

I've also seen some disheartening things about how hard it is to make friends in Van, is this specific to the city itself or is it more of a North American thing in general, like would I have a harder time making friends in Van as opposed to Toronto or NYC?

Nice thick hood, big pockets, and the brand is popular right now with kids so he might actually wear it.

There’s a few Companies running up North I’d think VAN KAM would be a good option I couldn’t see the harm in calling a shipping company first tho. You’d have to use a uhaul other wise or a large company cause you’d definitely want insurance driving up North. The roads if you’ve never driven them can be somewhat treacherous and most would advise you against it. Unless you have a 4x4 a empty uhaul will be crap once the bikes in there you’d be a lot better but still. Just food for thought. It’s all possible either way I think it’s going to cost you somewhat.

I had an inexperienced nanny (basically a recent high school graduate) for $18 an hour. More experienced nannies were $20-25. Where exactly are you looking? I have used canadiannanny.ca and nannyservices.caThere is a maximum room and board deduction of $325 per month if you want a live in nanny.

651,no,vancouver,RainbowDonkey473,Why are nanny or living at home nanny pay so low in Vancouver ?,"You clearly have never lived in Vancouver which is one of the most expensive cities to live in the world.When you consider your compensation for any nanny position, you need to include the cost of living in that city.  So while you might be earning $500-600 a week in income, you are also saving about the amount on rent.  Unless you plan to live outside of Vancouver and add the cost of commuting to work ($150/month), the rent costs in Vancouver range from $1500-2000 per month.  Can you afford that?Working as a nanny in the home means you don’t have monthly rent and transportation costs.  You need to factor these costs in.  Living in someone else’s home also means you don’t pay water, heat, internet, taxes, etc.  tl/dr:  your math is messed up when considering working where you don’t already live.  If you have to relocate for a nanny position, you are not calculating your cost of housing.  If you want more pay for similar work, you need to live out of their home which will mean all your income goes into rent and monthly costs.",,8,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qogz6b/why_are_nanny_or_living_at_home_nanny_pay_so_low/hjomfxj/,2021-11-07 15:34:41,2021,11,7

666,yes,vancouver,ExcuseGeneral826,Architect salaries are insanely low in Vancouver yet Architectural firms are insanely profitable.,"Architecture isn't the only industry that underpays in Vancouver; people make claims about the ""sunshine tax"" and proximity to the mountains/oceans as justification for low wages. All of that is complete BS.I'm picking on architecture for a few key reasons: First, it's allowed to operate in the way it does due to poor oversight from the governing professional body. Second, there is a severe ripple effect throughout the entire construction industry created by bad architecture; this effects many right down to the eventual purchasers of the homes. And lastly, architectural firms are actually quite profitable - proof of such being the fact that very few have gone out of business.Some key observations:* The quality of construction drawings has degraded significantly in the last 10 years. This seems to have accelerated over the last 5 years. A Building Permit set from 10 years ago is more complete than ""Issued for Construction"" drawings today. The drawings in Vancouver (and surrounding municipalities) would instantly be rejected in other jurisdictions. Drawings from a good number of firms fail to meet the most basic of contractual obligations.* There appears to be drawing sets that have not been reviewed at all. Municipalities generally have full-time plan checkers working in-house (some are really good at their jobs, other's not so much). There are also ""Certified Plan Checkers"" where a professional in the architectural (or semi-related field) can be given a designation where they can also approve plans. I don't know much about these beyond the basics, but it appears than many architectural drawings are not being reviewed at all, by anyone. Is anyone checking-up on the plan checkers?* Other jurisdictions have far better oversight as it pertains to architectural design, as well as professional conduct. It's interesting to note that national and international firms that also work in the lower mainland actually lower their standard of quality here compared to work they partake in elsewhere.* It's very likely that certain tasks are being outsourced - there is often extremely long turn-around times for simple site instructions (generated from errors in the architectural drawings). The costs of this long turn around times and subsequent mistakes are borne by others while the architecture firms pocket the savings.* If the architectural drawings are ""off"", other drawings tend to follow. At the very least this can dramatically increase the cost of a project. And at worst, it can become a human safety issue (it's harder for structural engineers to design a building properly with flawed architectural drawings).* Principals seem to be very well compensated, especially ""friends and family"" type principals. At the same time they don't seem to do much and are always on vacation. Employees who actually perform the work however... many salaried employees are actually earning the equivalent of minimum wage after considering how much overtime they work. These firms are complete managerial disasters, where, in other sectors, would be forced to dismiss their management teams to simply just survive. Yet we see architectural firms like these thriving...Architecture is an interesting example. Sure lots of people want to live and work here. But these low wages are more due to a lack of oversight from the governmental rather than actual labour market conditions. If these firms were help accountable for their work, they would either be forced to improve their quality or go out of business. When a higher level of quality is demanded, higher pay follows. Professional bodies can go a long way towards making that happen. And doing so tends to be better for society as a whole.",111,109,0.85,Ask Vancouver,/r/vancouver/comments/qobmdi/architect_salaries_are_insanely_low_in_vancouver/,2021-11-06 23:07:56,2021,11,6

666,no,vancouver,SuperRonnie2,Architect salaries are insanely low in Vancouver yet Architectural firms are insanely profitable.,"I agree with most of what you’re saying except that you need to replace the word “architect” with “developer”. My dad was an architect in Vancouver for 30+ years and I can tell you firms absolutely do go out of business. He was laid off 4-5 times precisely for this reason. The planning, approval and project management involved in putting up a tower in this city is incredibly complicated and has gotten much more so in the past 15-20 years. Plans are often changed at the last minute (usually by the developer, not the architect, to add more units or to scale back on costs or deal with some other unexpected roadblock). Approvals are delayed or cancelled altogether, and they have to listen to neighbours gripe about how the don’t like the colour of the handles on the front door.

666,no,vancouver,BC-clette,Architect salaries are insanely low in Vancouver yet Architectural firms are insanely profitable.,"Architectural labourers are exploited in myriad ways, most commonly underpaying and overworking on the basis that architectural work is ""artistic"" or ""creatively fulfilling"" when it is no different from any other form of labour. Architecture is one of the only professions in Canada exempt from overtime laws. Principals at architecture firms exploit the established mythos of architecture as a ""honourable"" profession to justify overworking and underpaying of even their most senior underlings. This stands in stark contrast to the reality of architectural production, which serves almost exclusively to enhance the wealth of the wealthy while contributing as little as possible to the community to maximize profits and to further the commodification of real estate. There is simply no honour in this.The AIBC does nothing to help protect architects, it exists solely to protect the title of ""architect"". The AIBC should be disbanded and architectural labourers should replace it with a union that represents them and their rights as workers. This is already the case in Scandinavian countries where a Master's degree is the equivalent of a license to practice. Of course, this will never happen because the vast majority of working architects are completely entrenched in the established mythos of the profession.source: have a M.Arch and know many architectsedit: minor additions",,3,,,/r/vancouver/comments/qobmdi/architect_salaries_are_insanely_low_in_vancouver/hjpoql1/,2021-11-07 19:46:01,2021,11,7

The only highway in the province that is open going from east to west and north to south connecting the lower mainland through the rest of the province is highway 3.  It is currently only open to trucks/transportation vehicles and is closed to the general traffic right now as the crews are still trying to repair damage on that highway.
