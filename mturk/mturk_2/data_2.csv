112,Is there any hope?,"How do you not become desperate? My country is enduring a terrible heat wave. I researched online. Isn't it that, if we don't manage to stop global warming right now before it hits 2°C, we're basically all doomed? I have the feeling this is not taken seriously enough and that only few measures are taken against climate change. Any optimistic voices? Anything? How do you deal with climate change worries?",https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/o3tj8s/is_there_any_hope/,20/06/2021,climate
28,Why is this year's summer so cold in Europe and so hot in North America?,Central Europe's summer this year has been weeks of rain and temperatures rarely if ever extending 22°C while Canada and the USA have had heat records of over 50°C. This seems a bit strange to me and I don't quite understand how it works.,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/ojy3cz/why_is_this_years_summer_so_cold_in_europe_and_so/,14/07/2021,climate
35,Do climate models account for additional emissions from forest fires?,I would guess forest fires cause quite a bit of emissions (though I am curious to see how they compare in the big picture). Do climate forecast models assume some number of forest fires contributing as things heat up? How much of our forests should we expect to lose in the next 10 years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/oixony/do_climate_models_account_for_additional/,12/07/2021,climate
126,What do you guys think is going to happen to LA in the several decades?,"This is coming from somone who is planning on pursuing a career in the animation industry their but is concerned that by the time I'm able to have the career/job I want there climate change will render Los Angeles unlivable. I mean look at the forecast 120 degree heat, worst drought ever, and like worst fire season ever. My only hope is that Hollywood moves like the rest of Californians and a state like NY will be the new home of Pixar and Disney and the rest of Animation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/nzbem1/what_do_you_guys_think_is_going_to_happen_to_la/,14/06/2021,climate
141,Increased precipitation,Is global warming going to cause more precipitation in some regions while decreasing it in other regions.  With the heat down phenomenon will it be drier within the dome and perhaps cause more precipitation along the edges of the dome?,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/opr5y4/increased_precipitation/,23/07/2021,climatechange
142,Climate change is very good for my area.,"Not going to lie honestly being in Texas climate change is great. Right now usually we are in terrible droughts, crazy amount of heat 100+ and everything is dead. We are usually asked to conserve water for watering lawns. This year has been so different and it's amazing. We are having amazing amounts of rain. Everything is green and alive with low 90's. I can't complain about this shift in climate at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/opqfao/climate_change_is_very_good_for_my_area/,23/07/2021,climatechange
156,100% Renewable Energy Tariff,"Considering that Energy & Heat industry accounts for emitting roughly 25% of Co2 pollution. I’ve made the conscious choice to only choose a 100% renewable electricity tariff moving forward. My supplier is Shell, which is slightly controversial I know, however I’ll investigate other ‘non controversial’ companies once my tariff ends. Indeed, I’d like to understand if this is actually 100% renewable (hydro, solar, wave or wind) and not also just ‘Carbon offsetting’. I’ve been thinking for a while what extra I can do, and feel this is something really easy that households could implement and push the “green” agenda. I know these tariffs are generally more expensive, but guess enough is enough and sacrifices ought to be made for a better world.Will everyone be doing the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/onaezc/100_renewable_energy_tariff/,19/07/2021,climatechange
269,Just me or has some tipping point blown up in the last 12-24 months?,"Is it just me or has the last 12-24 months seen a huge increase in freak events (bushfires, floods, heat waves, etc.)? These aren't 'normal' freak events like the years before. The severity has stepped up considerably. We have climate change related disasters killing hundreds of people in developed nations now. Bush fires clearing out unimaginable swathes of forest in developed nations. Did some tipping point get reached like some ocean current stopped? Reduction of dimming effect from soot?",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ol84nm/just_me_or_has_some_tipping_point_blown_up_in_the/,16/07/2021,collapse
410,"Record breaking heat, drought, and reopening. Does anyone think this 4th of July is going to be a spark that ignites many forest fires?","With restrictions lifting and people finally getting together to celebrate for the first time in over a year I believe people are going to be more reckless this 4th of July when it comes to fireworks. This combined with record heat and lack of rain in the west could be a dangerous situation. I hope that people in fire prone areas can use common sense to not set off fire works this year, but I do not have much faith in our common sense as a whole.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/o70h2w/record_breaking_heat_drought_and_reopening_does/,24/06/2021,collapse
73,Can the impending climate crisis be completely avoided ?,"There are a lot of talks on the internet of ""slowing down"" climate change or limiting it's effects. But I would like to know if we can completely overturn the damages we've done to the climate.According to [climate.gov](https://climate.gov) ,Even if all human emissions were to stop, the heat emitted by the earth is still going to increase for decades due to the heat trapped in the oceans.So even if we make very drastic changes (which is unlikely to happen)  there looks like there is no way to stop the impending climate doom.I would like someone to tell me if my analysis is correct and please be pragmatic and realistic, not looking for optimistic or sanguine replies.Also, realistically what would a climate doom day look like ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/oce0ja/can_the_impending_climate_crisis_be_completely/,02/07/2021,climate
