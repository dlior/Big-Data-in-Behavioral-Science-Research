66,180,collapse,"british columbia, canada is getting a crash course in collapse.","people in bc live in floodplains and right next to forests. floodplains flood naturally and forests burn naturally. it is the hubris of man to think otherwise. bc pumped out a lake next to a major river and build a community on it. obvious that is going to flood. that has nothing to do with capitalism or climate change. it is just 100% stupid. you can't win an argument against mother nature. the real collapse is the coming energy shortage as oil production falls off a cliff from esg mandates and renewable additions are for much less energy. as well the global food industry is going to be severely damaged from higher oil prices as food production is really a subset of the oil industry. i have a hobby farm and do organic farming, let me tell you the cost of the renewable energy i have and the organic farming is staggering. i'm wealthy and do it for fun and as a prepper to get ready for the low energy future, but my energy and food cost is much higher that what people would think (including time for farming). the key to avoiding collapse is to find a sustainable community (like if you build a house would it be there in 200 years without human intervention) where you can use off grid energy sources (purchased in next two years as skyrocketing demand will make it unattainable), produce much of your own food and that has robust connections to legacy oil and gas to support industry and higher intensity farming for as long as possible. places lacking this will be cutoff from modern industrialized living. people in major coastal cities are going to be fretting about climate change, buying expensive teslas while their way of life will become rapidly unaffordable and unstainable thanks to 7% natural decline in o&g production coupled with low investment in new production. having an electric car won't help them as industrial society runs on oil, gas and coal and will for decades. already in the us we can see cities being taken over by migrants and homeless. if your energy comes at the end of a major transmission pipeline, you'll be first to get cutoff as supplies dwindle and climate alarmists attack vulnerable rural transmission equipment. ne bc is a particular good location for future sustainability. vancouver island has good hydro sources and a good growing climate in some regions. no oil for tractors and no gas for heat though. better than most of interior.",18/11/2021,canada_flooding
