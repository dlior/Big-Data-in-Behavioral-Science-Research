1,100% Renewable Energy Tariff,"Considering that Energy & Heat industry accounts for emitting roughly 25% of Co2 pollution. I’ve made the conscious choice to only choose a 100% renewable electricity tariff moving forward.
My supplier is Shell, which is slightly controversial I know, however I’ll investigate other ‘non controversial’ companies once my tariff ends. Indeed, I’d like to understand if this is actually 100% renewable (hydro, solar, wave or wind) and not also just ‘Carbon offsetting’.
I’ve been thinking for a while what extra I can do, and feel this is something really easy that households could implement and push the “green” agenda. I know these tariffs are generally more expensive, but guess enough is enough and sacrifices ought to be made for a better world.

2,Can the impending climate crisis be completely avoided ?,"There are a lot of talks on the internet of ""slowing down"" climate change or limiting it's effects. But I would like to know if we can completely overturn the damages we've done to the climate.
According to climate.gov ,Even if all human emissions were to stop, the heat emitted by the earth is still going to increase for decades due to the heat trapped in the oceans.
So even if we make very drastic changes (which is unlikely to happen) there looks like there is no way to stop the impending climate doom.
I would like someone to tell me if my analysis is correct and please be pragmatic and realistic, not looking for optimistic or sanguine replies.
Also, realistically what would a climate doom day look like ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/oce0ja/can_the_impending_climate_crisis_be_completely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3,02/07/2021,climate
